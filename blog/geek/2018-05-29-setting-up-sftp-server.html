    <h2>Setting up a Chroot Jail SFTP Server</h2>

    <br/>

    <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<p>We are going to imagine a simple situation. You have, in your control, a server
class machine, exposed to the world as 'www.myfantasticserver.com'. On this
server, is a hard disk (logical or physical) mounted as '/data'. Now, you wish
to allow someone, let's say user 'abc' to place some files on this storage
volume and retrieve it. Assuming your server is a Linux machine hosting a Debian
based operating system (such as Debian itself or Ubuntu), we are going to try
and achieve the following. (With a little adjustment, it should work for non
Debian distributions as well.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a user to access the storage space using a GUI friendly client such as
  Filezilla.</li>
<li>When the user logs in, the user will only see their folder and nothing else.
  In other words, they will not have the ability to see the parent folders of
  the folder assigned to them. (This is called a 'chroot' jail.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) based servers and clients were
used for this purpose. The machine willing to host the files would have to setup
an FTP server and the users logging into the machine would have to use an FTP
client to access the files. But this is a very insecure protocol. All
communication over this protocol, whether it is the authentication password or
the files themselves, is unencrypted.</p>
<p>A more modern approach is to setup an SFTP server (a secure FTP). However, the
name is a little confusing. It seems to suggest that instead of installing some
kind of an FTP server, you will install an SFTP server. Actually, the SFTP
server is a part of the OpenSSH software which implements or enables SSH (Secure
Shell) communication with your server. So, the first step is to install this
software, if not already installed.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo systemctl start ssh.service
$ sudo systemctl <span class="nb">enable</span> ssh.service
</pre></div>


<p>All SSH communication happens through port 22. It is therefore extremely
important to ensure that in case there is a firewall system enabled on your
machine, it allows incoming traffic through port 22. On a Debian based machine,
a typical firewall software is the "Uncomplicated Firewall" which can be
accessed using the command <code>ufw</code>. To enable all incoming SSH connections,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ sudo ufw allow ssh
</pre></div>


<p>If you wish to have a more  fine grained control over whether SSH should be allowed only from
a particular network, please refer to the excellent tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands">available on
Digital Ocean's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Configuring the Secure Shell</h3>
<p>How the SSH server behaves is governed by a configuration file
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>. We need to modify its behavior to setup an SFTP server.
Since these files are critical and the smallest of modifications to this file
can lead to a breakdown of the service, it is a healthy practice to back it up
before changing it.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> /etc/ssh
$ sudo su
<span class="c1"># cp sshd_config sshd_config.backup</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, we edit the file. You can use 'vi', 'vim' or 'nano' to edit the file. You
need to find a line that says <code>Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server</code> and
replace it with <code>Subsystem sftp internal-sftp</code>. You may find that there is no
need of such a replacement but if there is, please do so. Not too long ago,
'sftp-server' was a stand alone program requiring its own separate process but
now there is an internal SFTP module within the SSH server. By performing this
replacement, we are conveying our intent to use this module instead of the older
stand-alone server.</p>
<p>Next, we will tell SSH to do the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Take all users who belong to the group 'sftponly'</li>
<li>Force them to be controlled by the submodule 'internal-sftp'.</li>
<li>Let them locked inside a special folder which they will think of as a root
  directory (construct a chroot jail for them).</li>
<li>Take away their rights to access the graphical X11 server.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is achieved by adding the following lines in the 'sshd_config' file.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Match Group sftponly
        ChrootDirectory /data/sftpusers/%u
        ForceCommand internal-sftp
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTcpForwarding no
</pre></div>


<p>And finally, we restart our server to reflect the new additions/edits to the
configuration file. Make sure the following command does not give you any error.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</pre></div>


<p>Since we need users to belong to 'sftponly' group, let us create that group.
Further, we are going to give a non-conventional home directory for each user
i.e. '/data/sftpusers', so let's create that as well.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># groupadd sftponly
# mkdir /data/sftpusers
</pre></div>


<h3>Creating a New User to Login to our SFTP server</h3>
<p>For any user, one needs to follow these steps. If you find yourself creating too
many users (because your server is meant to be a dedicated SFTP server), you
could make a shell script out of the following commands. First step, creator the
user. We use the '-m' to demand that the user's home directory be created
automatically and the '-d' option to specify the home directory (since we need
it to be something other than the usual '/home' directory).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># mkdir /data/sftpusers/abc
# useradd -d /data/sftpusers/abc abc
</pre></div>


<p>Add the user to sftponly group and also deny them any default shell (so that
they cannot control the command line once logged in this machine),</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># useradd -g sftponly abc
# usermod -s /bin/false abc
</pre></div>


<p>It is important that the directory which will be used a chroot jail for any user
be under the ownership of the root. So, '/data/sftpusers/abc' should be owned by
the root. If you created this directory as a root, this should already be the
case else you can change the ownership easily by saying,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># chown root:root /data/sftpusers/abc
</pre></div>


<p>Now, here is a problem! Because of the requirement that the main folder which
will serve as the jail be owned by the root, we have left no place where the
user in question will have write access! So, let's create a mock home directory
for the user within the folder and make the user its owner.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># mkdir /data/sftpusers/abc/abc
# chown abc:abc /data/sftpusers/abc/abc
</pre></div>


<p>Final step is set a password for the user.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># passwd abc
</pre></div>


<p>Done! Your user is setup.</p>
<h3>Accessing SFTP using FileZilla.</h3>
<p>FileZilla is a friendly program which can be run on all major operating
systems which allows easy access to an FTP/SFTP server using a simple GUI.
Please refer to instructions specific to your OS for installing this. Once it is
installed, you can launch the program. At the top are four fields - server,
username, password and port.</p>
<p>The server can either be the hostname or the IP address. Generally, when
accessing SFTP over a LAN, it will be an IP address beginning with <code>192.168</code> but
it could be a name if the local administrator has setup a local DNS server. For
a public facing machine, the domain name or IP can be provided. The username and
password should be as set in the previous section. <em>It is important to note that
the port should be set to 22.</em> FileZilla assumes the connection is an FTP
connection which uses port 21 for negotiation (authenticating user and for
commands) and therefore you may get an error if it is left blank. Clicking
QuickConnect should show the a directory with folder 'abc' inside it. All files
should be transferred to this location.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
