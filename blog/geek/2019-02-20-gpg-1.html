    <p>This article is the first of two articles aimed at explaining how secure
communications work and how GnuPG (the GNU Privacy Guard) can be used to secure
our communication, verify the authenticity of a communication and other things.
The first article aims at explaining the basics of encrypted communication while
the second article aims at trying to help you secure yourself using the GNU
Privacy Guard.</p>
<h3>Symmetric Encryption</h3>
<p>Consider Alice and Bob, two people who wish to communicate with each other
securely and privately. Alice fires up her e-mail composer, writes what she
wishes to write and hits the Send button. Bob opens his Inbox and reads the
e-mail. This is how the problem of communication itself has been solved, by
using e-mail.</p>
<p>Mallory wants to eavesdrop on the conversation. He simply writes a packet
sniffer program, a program that keeps monitoring the information sent between
Alice and Bob. With relatively little effort, he is able to see the message
Alice sent to Bob. This is the problem we are trying to solve. We need to
prevent Mallory from reading what Alice intends to be read only by Bob. How do we
do it?</p>
<p>Let us clear one thing first. It is extremely hard to control what happens
between all those wireless and wired transmissions that take place once Alice
hits the Send button. So, you can hardly prevent Mallory from being able to
capture  the 'packets' of information running all over the world as a result of
the Send button being clicked. What we wish to achieve is that Mallory will not
be able to make sense of any information captured by him. In other words, we
wish to encode our informaiton in such a way that Mallory cannot make sense of
it BUT BUT BUT ... Bob, the intended recipient should be able to make sense.
This is called encryption.</p>
<p>Let's see the simplest example of how communication can be encrypted. Consider
the following message.</p>
<p><code>i love you</code></p>
<p>We now adopt a simple (and perhaps one of the oldest) schemes to encrypt this
message. We shift each letter by 2 in the order it appears in the English
alphabet. 'a' becomes 'c', 'e' becomes 'g' etc. And our message now transforms
to:</p>
<p><code>k nqyg aqw</code></p>
<p>Note that since there are is no letter after 'z', we have rewound to 'a' in the
case of 'y'. Now, that looks hard to read, isn't it? If Mallory were to capture
this content, he would not be able to make sense of it. But so would Bob! For
Bob to be able to make sense, Alice would have to tell Bob what kind of
encryption was used and also mention the number '2' to indicate by how many
places should Bob shift back each letter to recover the message. This '2' is
known as the 'key' because it sort of unlocks the message.</p>
<p>How does Alice convey the key i.e. number '2' to Bob? One could argue that she
would use an alternate secure connection to convey this but that is not the
solution. Firstly, there is hardly anything such as a secure channel in the
world of Internet but even otherwise if there was a secure channel which Mallory
could not access, then she could send the message itself through that secure
channel!</p>
<p>Because the key K that encrypts the message and the key K that decrypts the
message are the same, this method of encryption is called <strong>symmetric
encrytion</strong>. And we cannot use it, as explained above, for communication over a
network or the Internet.</p>
<h3>Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
<p>Let's now see another form of communication that takes us closer to solving the
problem. Bob generates a pair of keys - K<sub>public</sub> and
K<sub>private</sub>. The private key is kept secured, never exposed publicly to
the world and depending on how diligent Bob is, highly guarded and secured. Here
is the interesting thing, his public key is kept completely exposed. He sends it
people via e-mail, even makes it available as a downloadable file on his web
site and in fact even publishes it on a public server where people can search
for it!</p>
<p>Alice therefore can easily discover K<sub>public</sub>. She uses this to encrypt
any message she wishes to send to Bob. Now, here is the ingenuity behind the
encrytion algorithm being used by her. There is a special mathematical relation
between K<sub>public</sub> and K<sub>private</sub> so that what is encrypted by
one <strong>can only be decrypted by the other</strong>. Since the key that encrypts is not
the key that decrypts, this form of encryption is called asymmetric encryption.</p>
<p>Since Alice encrypts using K<sub>public</sub>, the <strong>only way her message can be
decrypted is using Bob's K<sub>private</sub></strong>. And note that Bob has
safeguarded this very carefully. If Mallory were to capture the message, since
he does not have access to the private key of Bob, he will not be able to
decrypt the message at all (unless Alice and Bob have used a weak algorithm to
encrypt with known security holes).</p>
<h3>Digital Signatures</h3>
<p>Before we move on to the next article which goes into hands on, one last concept
to explain is that of a digital signature. Let us consider another problem.
Alice wants to publish something relatively publicly. She does this. Bob
discovers this and downloads it. As he peruses the material, he grows a little
suspicious. Did Alice really write this? It doesn't sound like her. How does Bob
verify the content in front of him is indeed Alice's?</p>
<p>Enter checksums. Consider the following text.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Hello World!
I am Alice. Find Mallory.
Kill him not, keep him alive!
</pre></div>


<p>A checksum algorithm is one that converts a stream of bytes like above and
transforms it into a collection of characters in an irreversible manner. For
example, running the following command on a file containing above text gives the
following output.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ md5sum some.txt 
727f0e11d7c4c8d2932048414332c611  some.txt
</pre></div>


<p><code>727f0e11d7c4c8d2932048414332c611</code> cannot be used to recover the content. This
is what we mean by checksums being irreversible. The second important property
of checksums is that the slightest change in the contents results in a
completely different checksum. Consider a subtly different version of the same
message by Alice.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Hello World!
I am Alice. Find Mallory.
Kill him, not keep him alive!
</pre></div>


<p>Notice the comma which changes the meaning of the message drastically. But let's
see what it's checksum will be - </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ md5sum some.txt 
d768054291acb3084480eb3d3b3f5aa7  some.txt
</pre></div>


<p><code>d768054291acb3084480eb3d3b3f5aa7</code> looks nothing like <code>727f0e11d7c4c8d2932048414332c611</code>!
And all that changed was a comma! Okay, what does this have to do with
signatures? Let's go back to the problem. How does Alice sign her work so that
people like Bob can be sure that she is indeed the author of this work and that
nobody has tampered with her work?</p>
<p>She creates a checksum of her work. She puts it at the end of it. Bob can
now calculate the checksum and compare it with the checksum Alice has put at the
end of the work. Meh! Mallory could recompute the checksum of his modifications
to Alice's message and replace her checksum as well.</p>
<p>So, Alice takes it one step further. She computes the checksum and encrypts it
using her private key. Since the public key is, well, public, Bob can easily
decrypt it using her public key. Then he compares the checksums to ensure that
Alice's message has not been modified. Now, suppose Mallory modified the
message, he could indeed replace the checksum but since he does not have Alice's
private key he will either not do so OR will use some other private key. But
then Bob cannot use Alice's public key to decrypt the checksum. So, Bob
immediately calls foul and refuses to believe what he is seeing and even warn
Alice or any consumer of Alice's work.</p>
<p>The process of computing a checksum and encrypting with your private key is
what we call 'digital signing'.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the next article, I will explain how to use GnuPG to achieve all of the above
in practice.</p>
