    <h2>Securing Your (Web) E-mail with GPG</h2>
    <span class="date"> Thursday, 28 February, 2019</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>This article assumes that you know the basics of asymmetric encryption and have
generated a public-private key already. If this is not the case, you must follow
articles to satisfy that assumption. I have written in the past two articles
titled "Towards using GPG For Security" which you can refer to, in order to
learn about encryption and also generate a public-private key pair.</p>
<p>Okay! So you have understood asymmetric encryption and how it works and would
now like to send secure mails to specific people. How do you go about doing
this? Well, if you have read the two articles cited above, you already have the
know-how of how to do this. You write down your mail in the form of a plain text
file and then run the gpg command to encrypt it. You can then send a regular
mail to the person you wish to and attach that file. The person on the other end
can download the file and use a relevant gpg command in order to decrypt it
using their private key (assuming you used the corresponding public key to
perform the encryption).</p>
<p>But this is inconvenient, especially if you would like to constantly sign your
e-mails OR encrypt them. In such a case, we would like to directly tell our
e-mail program to know how to find our public and private keys and use them to
secure the e-mails that we want. It is for this reason that a lot of people move
away from their web browser and use a tool such as Thunderbird or Outlook. So,
there are plenty of articles which already cover how to achieve the integration
of your GPG keys with these tools. Here is an 
<a href="https://linuxconfig.org/encrypt-your-email-with-gpg-thunderbird-and-enigmail">example of an article for
Thunderbird</a>.</p>
<p>However, I was always curious about whether I could achieve this goal without
actually configuring a stand-alone e-mail client and do the process of composing
a secure e-mail without leaving the comfort of the browser. It took me a while
to arrive at a solution. in this article, I am going to focus on extending
Mozilla Firefox to secure my GMail communication. With very slight adaptation,
these instructions should be able to work for Google Chrome and other popular
e-mail services.</p>
<p><strong>Step One: Install the Mailvelope extension for Firefox browser</strong>: To do this,
just, while in the Firefox window, just press the Alt key to reveal the menu
bar. Click Tools --&gt; Add Ons. Type Mailvelope inside search box labelled "Find
more extensions". In the search results, click on Mailvelope and click Install.
Depending on your settings, you will be asked to grant some permissions which
you can respond positively.</p>
<p>That's it. You now have Mailvelope installed. To confirm, notice the lock icon
in the top right region of your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two: Configure your Public and Private Keys</strong>: Click on the lock icon in
your browser. Click on Dashboard and now you will see some options in front of
you.</p>
<p>As this stage we need to choose the "Manage Keys" option. Here we can do a
couple of things. We can generate a public-private key pair. But note that this
will use an OpenPGP.js library in order to do so. And you will not get the rich
plethora of options available using command line gpg tool. Therefore I am
assuming that you have used gpg tool and constructed a public-private key pair
as well as a revocation certificate (which is always a good idea).</p>
<p>Export your public and private key if not already done so. For convenience, the
commands are as follows. For public key,</p>
<p><code>$ gpg2 --output &lt;email&gt;.pub.key --armor --export &lt;email&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>$ gpg2 --output &lt;email&gt;.pri.key --armor --export-secret-keys &lt;email&gt;</code></p>
<p>I can't stress this enough. The private key in the form of a file is something you
must treat with a lot of caution. Do not casually make it available on a web
page or store it carelessly in a pen drive which you will likely hand around for
people asking them to share their photos or videos.</p>
<p>Now, click on Import. Next, click on <code>Select a key text file to import</code>. From
the file browser, choose the public key file. Repeat the process and import the
private key. When you import the private key you will get a message which says
that it has identified the pair.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to import a couple of public keys of the people to whom
you will be sending encrypted e-mails. It is also possible for you to find the
public keys in this window itself using a public key server. At the time of
writing, the default public keyserver is that of Ubuntu. But it is possible for
you to change this easily.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Send an Encrypted Mail</strong>: Open your GMail and compose a new mail. As
usual, fill out the recipient's e-mail address and subject of the mail. And
now in the body of the mail, you will find an icon that looks like a notepad
with a pencil on it. Click it. And a new window shall appear where you can type
the private e-mail.</p>
<p>Once you have typed the e-mail you can click "Encrypt". If your private key is
secured with a password, you will be prompted for it. Please enter this and
press Ok. You will now see the body of the e-mail filled with something that
looks like this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-----</span><span class="nv">BEGIN</span> <span class="nv">PGP</span> <span class="nv">MESSAGE</span><span class="o">-----</span>
<span class="nv">Version</span>: <span class="nv">Mailvelope</span> <span class="nv">v3</span>.<span class="mi">0</span>.<span class="mi">2</span>

<span class="nv">VBDMuwTRKr6AMXD7uCC0DIrQAV2z8</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nv">ISovcSpJfUzK1boR2akMnWgkN8z7</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nv">Q</span>

...
...
<span class="o">-----</span><span class="k">END</span> <span class="nv">PGP</span> <span class="nv">MESSAGE</span><span class="o">-----</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That's it, you can now send this mail to the user by hitting "Send".</p>
<p>To sign your e-mail as well, you need to select this option from the Mailvelope
compose window. Just click on Options near the lower left region of the window
and you select the key you want to use to sign the e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Reading Encrypted E-mail</strong>:</p>
<p>Let's assume that someone has sent you a mail which is encrypted. It will
contain text which looks like the example above. If Mailvelope is configured
correctly, as soon as you move the cursor over such a text it will fade and a
lock icon will appear on it. Your cursor will also change into a key! Just click
and enter your private key password, then hit Ok. Then the encrypted body text
will be replaced with decrypyted text, assuming you are using the right keys and
passwords.</p>
<p>If the e-mail has been signed by the recipient, you can also see "Signed
digitally" link on the top right of the message box. Clicking it will verify
that the signture matches and display a message.</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, that's it. This is how you can secure your e-mail and sign it. And that
too, without leaving the comfort of the browser. But before we conclude, it's
worth asking that golden question.</p>
<p><strong>I am loading both my public and private keys in Mailvelope. Isn't that
dangerous?</strong></p>
<p>This is a perfectly valid and in fact a critical question. I was scared of
trusting Mailvelope too which is why I went on several forums discussing this
tool and here is a summary of reasons why I decided to trust it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, it is open source which means a lot of people have studied the source
  code and ensured that it treats your keys and other data with respect and does
  not divulge it in anyway.</li>
<li>It stores your keys on your hard drive, not in the browser cache or cookies or
  on some kind of a cloud store.</li>
<li>Even when it asks for the password to your private key, its default option is
  not remember it temporarily unless you choose to let it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps you! Happy secured communications!</p>
