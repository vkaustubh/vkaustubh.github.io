    <p>The first thing for a student of Physics to do is to ask himself – “what exactly
is the meaning of the word ‘Physics’?” And who is a physicist? That will lead
you to answer that Physics means the study of nature and hence a physicist is
essentially a student of nature. When you are learning Physics, you are probing
into the deep mysteries of the working of nature. And it is in the depth of
nature, that you can truly understand its complexity and also realize the beauty
within this complexity.</p>
<p>Step by step you start to probe into the different aspects of nature. In
Mechanics, you learn about the macroscopic worldview. Then you dwell into deeper
subjects until you realize that this whole universe is made of atoms. Probe
still deeper and then you find that atoms are made of several more things. Then
try to understand how these things behave, what are their characteristics and
then you realize the true complexity of nature. You must stop by to marvel
nature, as we know it and wonder how these things – the particles jiggle in such
beautiful synchronization to produce the colors, sounds and even life.</p>
<p>Even in the ancient science of Astronomy, we realize the insignificant position
that we have in this universe. Considering that Einstein is right and that we
really cannot exceed the speed of light we are then left with the conclusion
that we seemingly cannot cross even our own Solar System. Why then, should we be
full of pride even after realizing that we are so insignificant? I do not
understand. I don’t want to talk about the layman but I want to talk about a
physicist, someone who understands how truly beautiful nature really is.</p>
<p>So, what I feel is that a person, no matter how much he has studied has no right
to call himself as a man of science if he cannot humble down in front of nature.
A person who is into science must also have humility provided he has understood
science truly.</p>
