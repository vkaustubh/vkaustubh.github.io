    <h2>Silly Days</h2>
    <span class="date"> Wednesday, 20 September, 2006</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>One fine day I sat in front of my PC checking my emails and I found that I had
received an email from an old friend of mine. The subject of the email: “Happy
Friendship Day” And then I thought about all the silly days that had come into
existence in the recent times. There was a day for your father, a day for your
mother, a day for your lover and I am not sure of this but probably there are
days for brothers and sisters too. I don’t approve of them quite frankly. I
don’t quite understand the logic of dedicating 1 of your 365 days (or 366 if the
year happens to be leap) for some relation of yours.</p>
<p>One day, during a course of a discussion, one of my friends tried to demonstrate
to me the importance of having these days. He asked me visualize a scenario. He
asked me to consider two good friends whose relationship had been strained
because of some misunderstanding. Since the “bad day” the event had taken place
they were not talking to each other. But on one fine day, they notice the date
shown by the calendar and the calendar also showed that it was Friendship’s Day.
Seeing this both of them were forced to rethink about their hindered friendship.
They began to recollect the good old days they had spent together as friends.
And slowly one took the initiative and picked up the phone. They talked over the
phone and said that it was the ideal day to patch things up. Hence, the
tradition of celebrating the Friendship Day had helped them rekindle their
relationship.</p>
<p>I thought over this scenario for some time and asked my friend as to how he
could justify the existence of Father’s Day or Mother’s Day. He sat in front of
me silently and seemed to have no answer to my question. And then he stands up
and offers some explanation. He asks me to visualize another scenario in which
the son has gone to some far off place maybe for his education or maybe for some
job. Since he is away from his family the existence of such days would make him
call up his father or mother and speak to them. And then I stood up emphatically
and said, “Exactly. This is what I am trying to tell you.”</p>
<p>Why is that we need the calendars to remind us that back home we have a mother
or a father who have worked so hard their entire lives to make our life? Why is
that we should need a calendar to instruct us that we should give a call and
speak to our parents, our brothers or sisters or our lovers? I mean it is
possible for me to understand the fact that a calendar could be used to remind
us of what work is to be done when and what meeting we have to attend on which
day and at what time; and what time which program on the television is going to
be aired but I do not understand why calendars should remind us what relations
we have in this world and that we must take time out for them.</p>
<p>With changing times our lives have become more and more mechanical. But have we
become so mechanical that we need to be programmed like robots to filter out
days in the year for each relationship? Have we become so mechanical that we
cannot celebrate these wonderful relationships on each of the 365 or 366 days of
the year? Celebration does not mean that we call and talk to every single person
every day. Though ideal, I guess it is not practical. But I sincerely pray that
there be enough humanity alive in all of us that we don’t need to be reminded by
the calendars through the medium of these “silly days” that there is something
in this world called a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, a friend or a
lover. Our life is defined by our relationships to a very large extent. Let us
cherish them every single day of our life.</p>
