    <h2>An Imaginary Conversation Between Me And A Friend</h2>
    <span class="date"> Thursday, 05 April, 2007</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p><strong>Friend</strong>: I have recently read the Da Vinci Code. Found it quite interesting. I
almost got convinced that what it says is entirely true.
<strong>Myself</strong>: Hahaha! Dan Brown has a way of writing that does that to a layman at
the first go.
<strong>Friend</strong>: Then I also happened to see a documentary which clearly gave convincing
evidences about the historical inaccuracies in the facts laid down by Dan Brown
in the book. Wonder what I ought to believe?</p>
<p>I smiled at my friend. He looked at me and said, "What do you believe, Kaustubh?
Which is more probable? Jesus being a bachelor or being a married man?"</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong>: To me, it does not matter, quite frankly.
<strong>Friend:</strong> You mean, the divinity of Jesus Christ does not matter to you...</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong>: The divinity of a person, according to me, depends on the man’s thinking
and the man’s actions. If a person thinks and preaches divine acts, he is close
to divine and if a person practices all divine acts, he is divine. As per the
stories, Jesus was someone, a man or son of God, whatever you want to say, who
showed compassion to fellow beings and provided support in a time especially
when they needed most. He preached words that aided men in a huge way. Hence his
act was divine. Now, his marriage hardly makes difference once we look at his
actions.</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: And assume it were true that he gave birth to a daughter. The act he
would commit to give birth, would it not compromise on his divinity?</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong>:Don’t we consider life divine? Don’t we consider the very arrival of a new-born
in this world a happy and a momentous occasion? Don’t we have ceremonies of
highest order in majority of cultures to commemorate such an occasion? Then, why
do we disgust at the act that is the cause for this event?</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: But what about the existence of Jesus’ heir right now on this planet
Earth?
<strong>Myself</strong>: Did Einstein’s sons bring about the revolutions Einstein did?
Blood is a material, a fluid. We ought to worship idea, we ought to worship
character, that is what is needed. We do not need bloodlines and heirs. We do
not need persons and portraits, we need ideas and philosophies. If we assume
that the nobility and holiness of Jesus Christ or for that matter anyone can be
transported through a bloodline, would not the living descendants of Jesus
Christ possess the same nobility and holiness and hence the same potential to
cause revolutions and aid people and give them strength? But we know somewhere
that the truth is that nobility does not flow through any bloodline. Jesus’
nobility and purity was in his heart and soul and not in his saliva, blood or
genes.</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong>: As long as humans make quests out of these trivialities there will be no
peace. We have people considered ideal and holy and we tend to imitate them in
physicality. We grow beards or wear clothes and live in the illusion of having
chosen a higher path. Nonsense! The path be solely determined by actions and
intentions and not imitations or arguments. He who shall be triggered by the
wave of arguments and discussions about Jesus’ bloodline and other issues and
walk down the roads in protest, break glasses, damage property and burn posters
bear in mind that he defies the very message of tolerance, peace and universal
brotherhood that Jesus is said to have preached. And he who bases his religion
on historical facts, cups or chalices, bloodlines and genes and not on
philosophies and ideas of universal peace will best be described as a hypocrite.
And this hypocrite will spread his disease and the world shall be engulfed in
hypocrisy. My biggest fear is whether this time there shall be a saviour?</p>
