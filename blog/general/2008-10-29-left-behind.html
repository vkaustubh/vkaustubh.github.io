    <br/>

    <p>In the process of meeting new people and seeing various homes, I have come
across two distinct types of households. One is a very typical and orthodox home
where you have the man who does the outside work and the woman who does the
inside work. The man’s job is to do a job and get money inside the home and the
job of the woman is to take care of the house and ensure that the house becomes
a home. I guess one does not actually need to talk much about such households
and what happens in them on a typical day because these are pretty well known in
our part of the world.</p>
<p>But I guess I should specify some common features of these households. You have
the man and generally he does not do any of the household chores. He does not do
the dishes, the laundry or cook the food and other household activities. Why?
Because, he is working terribly hard and is the sole man in the house to bring
in the money that is needed to run it in the first place! And then you have the
woman, who does all the household work and then helps the man out of the bed,
make his meals, button his shirt, so on and so forth. I guess you get the
general idea of what I am trying to say.</p>
<p>There is a new kind of household that is evolving in recent times. It has been
around for some time but the number of such households has been rising because
of the changing trends in the society. In this type of household, both the man
and the woman are working. Both are bringing the money into the home but the one
thing I find really sad in most of such households is that they retain all the
features of the previous type of households I just described. The man still
enjoys the privileges that come with being the sole money bringer and woman
still continues to do all the jobs without help as if she is not bringing in any
money at all.</p>
<p>And this picture really bothers me. Of course, these are my thoughts and if you
disagree with them, pray do not argue or fight with me for that will be
completely useless. If the woman has evolved and is now able to do what a man
can do, why has the man not evolved and is doing what a woman can do? Why is it
that the woman has doubled her responsibilities and the man is still sitting
around at the same level? If a woman has learnt to pay the taxes, has the man
learnt to make his own tea? If a woman has become the money earning machine, why
has the man not taken a single step to being a home maker? If a woman has become
financially self-reliant, why does the man still need the woman to dress him up
and help him find his slippers, coat, shirt, etc?</p>
<p>Do the simple math. Earlier, a man would do some X amount of work and the woman
would do Y amount of work. The magnitudes of both X and Y would be pretty close
to each other. Today, the woman is doing Z amount of work and this Z is almost
double that of Y. So, simple math tells us that this Z is definitely greater in
magnitude than the X. So, in other words the math tells us that man has kept
himself behind. I personally believe that a man has to evolve and adapt to the
change and bring about the equalization of the magnitudes of responsibilities
that once existed.</p>
<p>I have so far been unfair in my writing. I have not acknowledged that there are
indeed men who have brought about the equalization. But I should ask the
question – how many? I have not found too many! Again, I will admit that this
analysis could be something unique to my part of the world. But I believe the
purpose of my writing this post down is not to conclude or prove. Nor is the
purpose of my writing to state what equalization means and how it should be
brought about. Equalization is relative, each man defines his own meaning of
equalization. The purpose is to induce a rethinking! We all have to rethink and
introspect and see if there is a need to bring about the equalization if it has
been lost. Are we being fair in sharing responsibilities? Or are we being left
behind?</p>
