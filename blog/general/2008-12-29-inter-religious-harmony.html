    <h2>Inter-religious Harmony</h2>

    <p>People sometimes can be found to be debating as to how this can be achieved! I
thought about this for a while and in the course of my journey through life
encountering various situations, meeting many people, listening and reading to a
lot of people I think one does not need to think about ways of achieving
inter-religious harmony. It had dawned upon me that one simply needs to
understand the meaning of religion better and the inter-religious harmony, as we
would like to call, follows in automatically.</p>
<p>Let us consider a man wanting to change to a certain religion X. What does he
do? How does he go about doing it? Let us just cook up an imaginary process of
his conversion into the religion of X. He goes to some committee or some head of
that religion and puts forward his wishes. He is welcomed and told to follow
some of the cultural norms of that religion. He changes his name, changes his
looks and starts learning the scriptures of that religion in order to facilitate
his conversion into that religion.</p>
<p>Days later you see him all dressed up looking like a typical man of the X
religion. You see him greet you in a style typical to that religion. He has to
remind you that he has to be called by his new name which was given to him by
the religious heads who prescribed the procedure for his conversion process. He
has started visiting a specific place of worship. To put in simple and short
phrase, he is doing everything that most people of the same religion X are
usually found doing.</p>
<p>Now, the important of all questions! Has he really “converted” into the
“religion” X? Some of you might choose to answer this question as a simple
“Yes”. But I would like to pose several more questions before I can convince
myself whether the person in question has really converted into the religion of
X! Perhaps in the course of these questions, you will come to know what I think
about “religion”.</p>
<p>The man has a thousand defects before joining this new X religion. Over the
course of his transformation, how many defects has he gotten rid of? Has he
managed to bring down these 1000 to even 995? Does each day of reading the
scriptures, each visit to the holy monument and each day of ritual reduce this
number from 995 to 990 and then onwards to lesser and lesser? Does each of the
above make the smile on his face broader? Does it make him happy on the inside?
Does he start becoming a better husband? Does he get rid of his jealousies? Does
he get rid of his obsessions? Does it help him control his actions? Does it make
him more charitable? Does it make him peaceful?</p>
<p>Has this man reached a point where suppose he is locked inside a room and told
that he will not be allowed to go to that monument today, does he say “I do not
care for my happiness is in me and does not reside in the monument.”? Say, he is
denied to read his scriptures; does he smile and say “All the scriptures are in
me! Their essence is in me. Their message is in me!” Say he is made to remove
all the attire that “defined” him as a member of the X religion, he smiles and
says, “If it makes you happy, go ahead. But my religion is in me, it is my
strength, it is my happiness and it is happiness that is inside me and not this
piece of cloth.” Further on does he say, “I am progressing! Progress is not in
my clothes and my looks but progress is inside me. How can you stop progress
when it is inside me?”?</p>
<p>I hope these questions have been more than enough to elucidate what I believe
religion is. We are wasting our time and energy when we seek the name, the
monument and the attire in defining a religion. Religion should be a journey
towards inner peace and strength. What’s in name and form? Member of any
religion, if he has found this via his practices should be able to recognize the
same in any other person who has found them. Would it then matter how he found
them? The fact is that if he has found them, he is on his way.</p>
<p>I believe there is only one step that can bring about inter-religious harmony –
understanding religion for what it really is and what it is meant to give.</p>
