    <p>I have noticed people lying at both ends of the spectrum. At one end, you find
people who are completely humble. There is not one bit of snobby tendency in
them and they are in almost perfect control of themselves. At the other end of
the spectrum are humans who have reactions quite similar to animals. They will
shout, fight, scream and burst out just like animals would give natural
responses to certain stimuli. As I saw people distributed across the spectrum, I
have always asked as to what could help people to acquire the other former
extreme. Why would one want to reach that extreme? Well, is it not what
separates us from animals? The power of asking “Why?” before taking every step!
The power of being able to sort out our thoughts instead of letting them dictate
our actions without our involvement!</p>
<p>Coincidentally it so happened that I came across some eminent academicians who
indeed fit the bill. I did a generalization and thought that academicians, after
years of disciplined study of their subjects in the greatest depth would have
eventually trained their minds to be more peaceful and more in-control. The
typical picture of an academician to me had become that of a man who pursues
knowledge like performing a sacred duty. He believes in the acquisition and
spread of knowledge. He disconnects himself from the common complaints of life.
But we all know that spending five minutes with people is different from
spending five fours or more with them. It is always easy to project the best of
yourself for five minutes to a person but it is difficult or nearly impossible
to project the best of yourself for more time.</p>
<p>I have now spent a significant amount of time among academicians and as an
academician myself. I turn back and laugh at how naïve and innocent was my
generalization of academicians. I realized that spectrum was more or less the
same here. There were people on both extremes of the spectrum. The animalistic
tendency of doing things not thought-out completely and purely out of some inner
uncontrollable thought process was evident here as well. The tendency to blurt
out and lose control was present here too. In fact, I felt that sometimes it was
more pronounced here. After all, these people have locked themselves away from
the world and taken great mental stress to reach the position that they are in
today, why not? Why would not the stress cause them to become irritable?</p>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge was for me a ways or means of realizing the
insignificance of the human race in the face of the marvels of nature. And
indeed you could find people quieted by their life’s journeys. But you find such
people very little in number. There are people who have grown proud of their
achievements and their intellectual superiority. There are people who do not
consider their own ignorance when trying to establish what they know to the
others. They walk with fear that they should not be proved inferior. They go out
of control and they become wild like animals. The problems that they face are
similar. They have frustrations, obligations, emotions and they are in-control
and out-of-control as anybody else.</p>
<p>Long years of hard work and studying the most difficult of subjects can give you
the necessary intelligence to perhaps do something more intellectual than the
layman. But of what use is the honing of the intellect when it does not help us
understand what drives us? Of what use is this vast collection of facts and
skills in our heads when they do not help us even control the relatively
easy-to-control emotions? How can the so called bliss found in knowledge be true
bliss when it so temporal? It is temporal, isn’t it? For if it were permanent,
would it not have given the bearer a stronger mind and a peaceful heart and
hence a better control?</p>
<p>The answer to the question as to what does help in acquiring that control and
that peace still runs away from me. I do not have a satisfactory answer. I do
not even find myself anywhere close to the answer as well. Sometimes I feel that
there is no answer to the question. Sometimes I feel that whether people are
born with some tendencies and there hardly seems to be any way to fight it.
There seems to be hardly anything a common man can do to change the world around
him. But the quest for the answer must go on. There is something on the inside
that drives us to search for the answer. Again, one does not truly understand
what that thing on the inside is! I guess it is best to not ask that one
question and keep looking walking forwards only with a desperate hope of finding
some meaningful answer to these bigger questions.</p>
