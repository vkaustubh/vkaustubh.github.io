    <h2>The End of Logic</h2>
    <span class="date"> Saturday, 30 May, 2009</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>The power of logic is beyond doubt. There cannot be any doubt that the power of
reasoning and logic have always given mankind huge amount of power. Power so
much that he now controls the fate of his world with a couple of buttons. Yes,
one button and the whole world can be destroyed! If nature chooses to destroy
someone, mark the end of his life, a couple of hours of precise work and a man
is able to reverse the effect thanks to the modern technology of medicine. A man
does not have to think twice before he steps out of his house and ventures on
some crazy adventure because he is hardly alone. He is able to carry a certain
device, a brain child of modern technology, which enables to him to stay in
touch with the rest of the world no matter how far he chooses to venture away
from home and for that matter civilization. But this power of reasoning that man
has used all this time in order to increase his powers and influence is so
limited!</p>
<p>How far has reasoning taken man when it comes to the questions of his own life?
When a man stops thinking about how he can achieve a certain material based
benefit and starts to ponder over tougher questions like life itself, we begin
to see the end of reason. The power of reasoning and logic fail miserably, isn't
it? Each man is taught by the world that his existence is temporary. There will
be an end to his life. There will come a time when he will pass away and make
way for the future generations. So, why does a man live? Why does a man lead
such an entangled life as if he is going to live forever. He thirsts and desires
for wealth and power in his life in spite of knowing that none if it will be
useful when death will stare into his face. He knows that no matter how powerful
medicine becomes, we still do not have a reply that we can give to the angel of
death when he knocks that fateful knock!</p>
<p>Fine, death is always assumed to be far away from us. Let us talk about life.
How much is logic important in driving us onwards in life itself? How much? You
cannot predict death and yet with the hope that there will be a tomorrow, you do
something today. What is hope? You need love of your friends and family and
several a people who have tried to run away from love or denied love have
suffered so much misery! What is love and what is misery? Mistakes are an
eventual part of life! Same is the case with repeating mistakes. In our day to
day relationships, we repeat mistakes often, cause someone to feel hurt and yet
we find it in ourselves to forgive and forget! What is hurt? What is
forgiveness? Even the people who study logic study it because they feel
passionate about studying logic! What is passion? And as we ponder over the
issues of lfie, we are eventually led to the questions of death. Death is like
the other side of the coin, one side being life. Both are inseparable!</p>
<p>Why do we procreate? When the eventual fate of the offspring and yourself is
death, why do we procreate? When there are a hundred examples of how miserable
our existence is, why do we keep hoping for something good and move forward?
Again, we do not know for sure what is hope and misery! But do we even know what
is good? Can logic give us the answer as to what is good and what is bad? Can
logic explain the craziness of a mother's love for her child, a lover yearning
for the love of his love? There are many more questions that one can ask only if
he breaks away from the mechanical existence of his life and think for some
time. I have similar questions! There is something called instinct. I don't know
what is and the best I can talk about it is that is a word that describes the
process of decisions coming out from the void, the wherabouts of this void being
unknown. I see life as being driven by instinct. And when we begin to question
instinct, I believe we reach the end of logic!</p>
