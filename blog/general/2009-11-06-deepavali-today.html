    <h2>Deepavali Today!</h2>

    <p>I am writing after a very long time. It sometimes happens that we just run out
of ideas or sometimes we just run out of the will to write our thoughts down
even if they might be plentiful in the mind. The bygone festival of Deepawali
produced a thought in my head that eventually won over me and asked me to pen it
down even though it has been more than two weeks since the festival. Festivals
have deep significance in all cultures. There are special reasons why those
festivals are celebrated and in many cases, I personally feel that the practice
was originally started to achieve a higher goal of personal development. But is
the original spirit prevailing today? That is a question I have been pondering
over since few weeks.</p>
<p>The smoke and sound of the Deepawali festival found itself a strong opposition
more than a decade ago from the mind that is currently typing these words. I
could personally feel choked when I walked out one fine morning, the next of
Deepawali. The whole city was covered in smog. And there was lack of the usual
morning freshness. I realized that what was different about that morning was
that lakhs of people had been adding pollutants for hours and hours together all
the way from evening to early morning. This left a lasting impression on me and
since that day I have never used fireworks. Just one of those incidents which
change your way of thinking forever!</p>
<p>This recent Deepawali was nothing different from the one I had seen more than a
decade ago. The same bursting of crackers, the extreme loud ones and the same
competitive spirit between people testing who would be the loudest and the
longest! But the circumstances were different. The number of species had
probably gone down. The area covered by forests had gone down for sure. The
levels of pollution had gone up. The climatic shifts were apparent. Sparrows and
some other birds could no longer be seen except in the outskirts of the city.
Two days later, when I was at the bank counter, the familiar lady teller asked
me, “How did you celebrate Deepawali?” I said, “I was reading the Ramayana!” And
indeed I did read Ramayana on that day. And she smiled and at me and said,
“Pleasing to my ears it is to hear those words for nobody today seems to be
doing that!”</p>
<p>We have gone overboard, I feel, as far as torturing the earth is concerned. And
on Deepawali, with the regular attitude, “One day won’t make a difference!” we
add new kinds of pollutants in these few days of festivals. And these pollutants
are not acceptable to nature! Nature’s mechanisms do not have the capability of
doing anything positive to the chemical particles that get added to the
atmosphere on this day. There are not your regular vehicular emissions, parts of
which can be recycled by surrounding green cover! Let us shift (abruptly?) to a
more religious issue.</p>
<p>What is Deepawali about? For those of you who might have forgotten, it is a day
that marks the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after achieving the purpose for
which he had stepped in this world, the destruction of evil. We mark this day by
creating an Awaali of Deepas i.e. a corridor of light. And that is what
Deepavali is meant to be! Make a corridor of lights near your houses and spend
time reading or hearing about the epic that elucidates the details. Where did
the sound and the smoke come from? They never were and never will have a place
in the true religious meaning of this festival.</p>
<p>Let me take you to the very beginning of Ramayana. The Earth deity makes a
eloquent plea to the Lord Brahma to do something about the torture and pain
being inflicted upon it by the Rakshasas under the rule of Ravana. And it is the
Brahma prays for the Eternal Being to incarnate in human form on Earth and take
it on Himself to destroy the evil of these Rakshasas. What is the relevance
here? Deepawali marks the end of the torture on Earth (and other abodes) and
today we celebrate it by torturing Mother Earth even more! We explode loudest of
crackers that scare the mute animals to death. We use carelessly manufactured
smoke spitting monsters and torture Earth like hell. We burst crackers in front
of hospitals without a second thought to the babies in the incubators and the
patients on the ventilators. We commit more sin on this holy day than any other
day! Is this what Deepawali is?</p>
<p>I am not asking you all to zero down fireworks! I have always seen it in people
many times. Their thoughts move only from one extreme to another extreme! The
above paragraph would have shifted their minds to a Deepawali celebration which
is devoid of all fireworks! I don’t mind if that happens but I know that the
common mind is not prepared to do that. But can we not spare one moment and at
least aim to minimize as much as possible? Could we not resort to perhaps a
newer variety of fireworks which perhaps are less polluting? Is it really
necessary to have the loud ones? Is it really necessary to burst them for hours
and hours together? It is really necessary to do it front of hospitals?</p>
<p>My sincere appeal to all of you reading this, please minimize the torture. Not
only on these few days of the festivals but on all days! Make a small
contribution however small it might be. Small reductions when multiplied among
large number of people will make a difference. Please celebrate Deepawali in its
true spirit! Please let it not become a materialistic indulgence that has a
negative of the original spirit!</p>
