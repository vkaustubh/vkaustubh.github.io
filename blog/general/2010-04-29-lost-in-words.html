    <p>I think the theme of this post is not going to be really new. Those of you who
have read the post "The Source of Knowledge" would find this article somehow
exploring similar subjects. For those of you who have not, let me briefly
summarize it by saying that the primary argument of that article was that a
broad minded journey through the ocean of life itself will be a very rich source
of knowledge. Not only will it be a rich source of knowledge but it will not
have an equal. I try to argue that a man must not isolate himself into the world
of books but go beyond books and explore the various facets of life if he truly
wants to enrich his knowledge. To me, at least, the topic itself is so
interesting that I can't but help divert a casual discussion on life onto this
topic. I have met the most brilliant of people who can quote from so many books,
none of which I would have even heard of. But a second thought makes me realize
that the ideas have always been around for ages. How could they not be? They did
not come out of nowhere. They came from a common occurence in life. But authors
are known for their ability to translate a common experience of the human life
into a rich collection of words that set them apart and also make the common
experience appear uncommon.</p>
<p>How simple thinking can be a complete failure is a fact that just does not cease
to amaze me. The simple thought that I am talking about is this: if someone
knows something then he or she is best prepared to handle any experiences in
life that come their way that requires one to have the knowledge of that
something. A simple and a a reasonable argument, don't you think? I thought too!
But it turns out, at least to me, that it is not. Just because you read about
death, it does not prepare you to face the loss of a near one. Just because you
have read about someone's struggle against all odds to come up in life does not
exactly prepare you to smoothly struggle against your own demons. It somehow
just does not work that way. A man's accumulated knowledge can easily go for a
toss when he finds himself into the deepest of waters of trouble. How easy it is
for one to say, "Have faith in yourself! You will pull through!" Somewhere,
something you heard or saw or read is perpahs making you say all this to the
weeping friend sitting in front of you. But can you say this to yourself when
the your time changes for the worse?</p>
<p>All words and thoughts are but maps while all first hand experiences are the
territory. This perhaps will sum up the above thoughts. Not only is it about day
to day life and about your personal experiences but it is also about religion
and philosophy. People are making careers out of stage shows in which they use
intellect and logic alone to argue in favor of their faith. It can be a
different topic that the application of logic and intellect can also be subject
to prejudice but let us leave it at that. How did ever religion get mixed up
with stage shows and logic snob?! Here is another one of those simple thoughts
that never showed life in it! Religion is a man's personal journey. Anyway, the
point regarding religion and philosophy is they seem to have become all
intellectual endeavours. People read day in and day out and discuss over drinks
the subtle meanings of words. But nobody seems to be walking the path! They are
lost in words. Hopelessly and completely! Their faith might tell them to do this
and that but they are not bothered. They are more interested in flinging words
and trying to prove their point!</p>
<p>Who are you anyway? Are you a man of X faith which teaches you to be this and
that? Then, why are you so lost in words and living under the illusion that the
study of the words is the study your faith's teachings? Why in the world are you
not practising what your faith is asking you to practise? Why don't you let the
actions speak for themselves because last I heard they apparently speak louder
than words? Why do you spend all your energies losing yourself in a maze of
words doing nothing but justifying your faith but all the while never following
it? Are you then an atheist who has faith in himself? Why you are then, sir, so
lost in your words which desperately try to justify your path of atheism? Why
don't you go onwards on your path and do what you believe? What are you going to
get spending time day in and day out indulging in exchange of words? What are
you going to get by coming up with a clever argument that for a moment has you
smiling? How is it going to change anything? How is it going to make you better?
You will remain the same or maybe become worse because of pride and poison but
never become better!</p>
<p>At this point in typing all this out, I am now at a loss of words as to what I
should say! I can't be sure but I guess the mind today seems to find some kind
of happiness in words and word play. My two cents - it is better for the mind to
create its own words from that rich source of knowledge called life rather than
to play and be lost in words.</p>
