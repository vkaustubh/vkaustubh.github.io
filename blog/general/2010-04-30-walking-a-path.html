    <h2>Walking a Path</h2>
    <span class="date"> Friday, 30 April, 2010</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>Every man chooses a path to walk on. Time and now he realizes that the path of
his choice is not good for him and decides to change his path. A key question to
ask is how this man knows how and when to change the path? The answer is
'bliss'. He contemplates in one way or another and searches for bliss. And when
he finds a great absence of bliss along the path of his choosing, he knows deep
down that it is time to change the path. All of us are making choices and one
thing that either consciously or unconsciously is governing these choices is
that bliss. We lay the path for us because we feel it is going to give us bliss.
And many a times it happens that a realization comes that the path chosen is not
the right one and hence the decision to change the course of life's journey.</p>
<p>Of all the paths we can follow the most difficult one is the path that no one
treads. It is difficult because it is lonely. But just because it is lonely, it
does not mean that the path is wrong. History in fact shows that the right path
has always been the one that made a person feel extremely alone. Of the billions
of people history remembers only a hand few. And of these hand few, some are
remembered for walking the right path, 'right' being defined as that which has
brought a positive change in the world. Does that not clearly say that the path
of the right was a lonely one? History also remembers a few who changed the
world for the negative and they have also been quite a few. But that says that
the path of the wrong was a lonely one too! What a dilemma!</p>
<p>This observation reminds me as to how true it seems that symbol of Taoism which
depicts the similarity between two extremities. Now, the path taken by a man
seems to him right when he can feel the bliss that comes along with it. And if
he does not feel that satisfaction, he no longer feels driven to walk the path.
So, that makes life very easy, right? Just choose a path and walk along it. Give
it some time and if it keeps you happy, well and good else search another path.
Continue until you find a path where you have been left with no room for
dissatisfaction at all. Is this it? Is this the algorithm of life? Sounds quite
simple! But have you ever heard of a proverb that celebrates the simplicity of
life? I haven't.</p>
<p>I have come across certain instances wherein the path lying ahead of me seemed
like the right one but the bliss was missing. It is difficult to describe this
situation in words. One has to experience it and contemplate hard on that
experience in order to get it right. But it does happen. The path in front is
convincingly good, the right one but the bliss is missing. Satisfaction has gone
for a toss. Smiles are lost! The strength is gone! Why? There could be many
answers to these questions, I do not know. And of course, as is the case with
life, no answer be right for sure and no answer be wrong! So, what is one
possible answer?</p>
<p>I suspect that walking the path is not enough. Knowing does matter! And by
knowing, I mean that it is essential for someone who is walking his path to know
what his path really is and be sure that he truly wants to walk on it. It seems
to happen that the man is walking the path that is best suited to him but for
reasons that could span from a lack of confidence to severe confusion, he does
not know that the path is right for him. This is when the man walking the right
path still finds no bliss and satisfaction in his life. They exist but their
existance has been clouded by doubt and uncertainty. All doubts be dispelled,
all uncertainty be removed and the same path can be a path of bliss again.</p>
<p>But but but! The question comes out - my path does not give me bliss, should I
be searching for the clouds and try dispelling them or should I be searching for
another path? We are talking about life here, how could one possibly give one
single answer? All that I could say is that blessed are those who can and find
the answer.</p>
