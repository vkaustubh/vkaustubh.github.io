    <br/>

    <p>For those of you who have read, “When Ignorance is Not Bliss”, you should find
the theme of this post similar to that. I am trying to convey in this post, a
message which I have learnt from my own experiences. And this time, the
experiences are more medical in nature than the geeky or techie experiences
elaborated upon in the other post. As I start typing this article, knowing what
I want to eventually talk about, I am reminded of a poem I read during my school
called “Ek Tinka” (A single particle). This poem was about telling people to
lower down the sizes of their egos for a single particle was capable of making
them cry or even killing them. What I am about to say is something similar.</p>
<p>I had to undergo a minor operation a month ago for a thing I did whose
triviality is often over estimated. Lip biting! I bit my lower lip in a moment
of intense thinking when I was completely lost and not at all conscious about
what I was doing. I guess most of us do these kinds of things when lost in our
world of thoughts. But a week later, I saw that a small part of the lower lip
had swollen. An immediate check on the net revealed that this was apparently a
‘mucocele’. I also learnt that these things normally swell further and further
until they eventually disappear on their own after bursting. But still, was it
indeed what I was reading about or was it something more trivial or more
malignant? Obviously, it was better to show it to a doctor.</p>
<p>My doctor told me it was indeed a mucocele. He advised a waiting period of 4-6
weeks for letting it go on its own. But this did not help. The mucocele burst
and reappeared 2-3 times before we finally decided that it was time to remove it
surgically. Now, I had heard all kinds of things about this procedure. I had
heard people complain that it left them cosmetically deformed for a very long
time and it was obvious that this was my major concern too. I had also heard
about not being able to eat properly for a week after the operation. Sounds
easy? No, sir, it ain’t! And moreover, this was going to be my first ever
surgical procedure and that was itself capable of giving a few goose bumps.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was fortunate to have a doctor who was very concerned about the
cosmetic outcome of the procedure and used a method quite different from what I
had read about. He carved a deep incision and removed the entire fibrous deposit
and instead of stitching my lips, he stitched a bolus onto it to prevent
bleeding and gave me two days for allowing what is called ‘epithileal
regeneration’, a fancy term that means ‘allowing the skin to grow back on its
own’. But for two days, I had that bolus stuck between my lips causing intense
salivation, not allowing me to speak and eat anything except the softest of
foods. Two days later, it was removed. The healing had been quite good and there
was no need for stitching the lip.</p>
<p>However, it was going to hurt if I try to consume food like a normal human
being! What I had to do for the next few days was apply an antiseptic and an
anesthetic gel to my lip before every meal and eat only with the spoon driving
the food directly to the back of mouth avoiding contact with my lip. There is a
hidden aspect to this which even the doctors did not mention to me and let me
set the record straight that the reason doctors did not tell this to me is
because none of their previous patients would have reported this to them! More
about this later! When you apply an anesthetic to your lip, it loses all
sensation. Obvious but what is not obvious is that when you lose sensation of
the lip, it does not warn you about saliva coming out of your mouth and by the
time you discover it, it has already drooled out of your mouth! I guess I can
call it one of the functions of the lip – preventing saliva from drooling out of
your mouth! And this is what happened to me as well and thus it was no longer
possible to sit with people and eat with them. It was very awkward. Thus, I had
to socially isolate myself at lunch and dinner tables while having meals at the
canteen.</p>
<p>All this suffering for an act which we usually call ‘trivial’! Lip-biting! Now,
I am not going to bite my lips any more after all this but I can hope that all
those who are reading will stop that too! But I do not want to end with just a
narration of this experience. There are other things I want to talk about as
well. There are other small things that we do that are very harmful. The easiest
to point out is sitting in a wrong posture. I have not seen many people keep
their backs straight and follow other “rules” about sitting when working their
day out at their work places which today are chairs in some office. My friend’s
father has severe vertebral column damage due to long term incorrect posture.
Heard of kidney stones? A common cause for their occurrence is the violation of
a simple rule – ‘drink plenty of water everyday’. And no, I am not reading this
off from some Wiki article but correlating the habits with people who suffered
of this.</p>
<p>As a final example, let me quote a very horrible one. This is about Dave
Mustaine, the leader of the heavy rock band ‘Megadeth’. And he is one of the
craziest and talented guitarists I have ever seen. One fine evening, under the
influence of alcohol, he fell asleep in a weird sitting posture. This posture
caused severe damage to his radial nerve and his hand was paralytic. To me, this
is all very scary! Just as an encouragement note, Dave Mustaine came out of it
against all odds, re-learnt the guitar, produced 2-3 new albums and gave several
world wide concert tours. But others might not be as brave or as lucky.</p>
<p>Apart from the word of caution that we must watch out for the smallest of
things, I also want to talk about a lesson I learnt about the doctor-patient
relationship. Feedback is very important. No matter what you are going through,
as long as it not really common like a common cold, it is always a good idea to
use some medium to communicate to your doctor about the problems you faced and
how you battled them during the course of your treatment. This will actually
allow your doctor to better warn or caution the future patients about the
problems they will face. I would not be surprised if the friendly doctors were
the most successful ones for I would be more than willing to share the tiniest
of my experiences with a doctor with an open ear rather than an impatient one.</p>
<p>I shall end this post for now with the hope that none of you ever have to face
big problems because of the small things!</p>
