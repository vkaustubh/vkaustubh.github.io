    <p>I wake up in the morning. No, I am not care free. I do have to go to work. I
look at the time as shown in my mobile phone. After a few minutes of lazying
around, I finally get up. I silently sit in my bed and think about all the
things that I am suppose to get done today. I have to go to the bank to deposit
my salary cheque. I need to go to the citizen center to pay my bills. Once done,
I would go to my office and quietly do my work. Sometimes, I wonder why I cannot
have private secretaries to do these jobs for me. But my routine does not allow
me to wonder too much and I go about my life as usual.</p>
<p>As I prepare to go out of my house, I see this really famous man. He emerges
from his car. There is a moment's peace but at least one common man recognizes
him to be someone really famous. Could it be really him? A few moments of
thinking and the doubts get dispelled as other members of the crowd start
resonating with the thought of the first. Soon, there is a large crowd moving
towards the man from the car struggling to get a good look at him. Suddenly, 2
more men alight, looking rather alarmed. Immediately they keep themselves in
between the crowd and the man. A struggle ensues. I wonder, how easy it is for
me to get out of the car and walk across the street into a building. But here is
a man who has struggled and got what others can only dream of - unlimited fame.
And he cannot even cross street without breaking a sweat. I smile to myself and
go about my work.</p>
<p>As I reach the bank, I cannot help but peeping into a newspaper being read by
another man. There is a an article with a very interesting headline - "Man
Arrested for Stalking Actress". This was turning out to be a very interesting
day indeed. The fact that a man could not cross the road without physical
assistance from some people despite being in the pink of his health had already
made me question the deepest of my desires to be someone famous, a celebrity!
And now, I have eyes fixated on this headline which makes me wonder how that
actress would have felt knowing that there was someone following her and
watching her wherever she went! Goodness,Â  what would I do if I was in her
place? I'd spend nights without sleep. I'd spend half my time looking around and
seeing if I could spot any suspicious character and also get alarmed each time
the door bell or the phone rang.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in my mind, I stood in the line waiting for my turn. And I
could not help but overhear the two people in front of me speaking to each
other. The conversation was about how a certain actor had called off her
marriage with another actor. They immediately pointed out an example of a
sportsperson who had been spotted going to the movies and restaurants with a
certain business man's daughter. And I again wondered, "How would I feel if
someone I did not know was interested in my marriage and other important
decisions that can be without doubt described as personal? How would I feel if
someone was keeping an eye out for me and the instant I ended up dating a friend
from the past two times, become the talk of the town and have pictures published
on the page 3 of all tabloids?"</p>
<p>The man who used to see the 'big people' sign autographs and wave to the crowd
and get inspired to do something with his life so as to enjoy such experience
was slowly being replaced by a man who suddenly realized how peace loving he was
indeed. How blessed did I feel that I was not going to wake up one fine morning
and find my own photo in the paper alongside an article talking about things
completely personal to me? How blessed I did feel when I realized that I could
almost walk out and go wherever I wanted without having to plan a secret
itinerary! No sooner did I share my revelation with another man, I got another
revelation. Not everyone in the world thought the way I was thinking. There
would still be people willing to accept all the cons that came with being a
celebrity for the pros were too overwhelming.</p>
