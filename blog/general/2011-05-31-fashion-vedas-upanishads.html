    <h2>The Fashion of Vedas and Upanishads</h2>

    <p>Think intellectuals! Think party! Think of both of these together! Does some
scene flash before your eyes? Some of you might picture men holding a glass of
golden water in a crystal clear and lustrous glass, making critical remarks on
the political scenario in the country or in the whole world. Theories flying
across about how one must do things in order to ensure world peace. Theories
flying across about how a certain law should be framed in order to prevent
certain adverse circumstances. In recent times, another topic of discussion has
apparently become a favorite among partying intellectuals. And no points for
guessing - the Vedas and the Upanishads.</p>
<p>The shocking series of events in the field of Physics post 1900 have led to many
physicists unable to control themselves from making philosophical remarks. And
who would blame them? Anyone who has even attempted to grasp the essentials of
these modern theories of Physics will perfectly understand why the founding
fathers of these theories retorted to making philosophical statements. Libraries
today are filled with books whose central theme is the philosophical
implications of modern physical theories. Among these books exist a class of
books which cannot but draw parallels between the ancient texts of India i.e.
Vedas and Upanishads and the findings of modern Physics.</p>
<p>The Vedas and Upanishads have come in the spotlight because of some well written
books by Westerners who earlier never imagined themselves reading and trying to
understand these ancient texts. If not the political crisis of the world or the
ever existing threat of terrorism, the Vedas and the Upanishads have become the
talk of these parties. Groups gather around. The one who manages to quote
Nachiketa from the Katho Upanishad wins the spotlight. If not, then someone who
manages to quote a verse from the Aryabhatiya wins the spotlight. There are
people who work really hard day and night in order to gain mastery over the
sayings of Krishna in the Bhagvat Gita, over the metaphysical exposition of Yama
in the Upanishads and over the true meaning of Ramayana and Mahabharata; only to
exploit this as an attraction seeker in a group of intellectuals drunk, if not
by consuming golden water, by their belief that their thoughts will change the
world.</p>
<p>The simplest proof that there is a difference between reading about something
and following something becomes precisely clear when you attend one such Veda
party. Opinions and debates will fly around for hours and at the end of the
night, when it is all said and done, the party but remains one event which
served the purpose of entertaining and perhaps in small proportions educating
but definitely not enlightening. The same intellectuals, who on the previous
night talked about the various statements in which the peace of the mind was
emphasized will land up in a foul mouthed argument over a petty thing the next
day. The same intellectuals, who talked about how selfless devotion and morality
was highlighted as a means of attaining the highest knowledge will remember the
beautiful red dress worn by one of his friend's wives.</p>
<p>To attain so much inertia that not one word from these texts can change you for
the better or the worse and to fill oneself with so much false pride that
knowledge of these ancient texts is but a tool to save your face in a
congregation of intellectuals is this fashion of the Vedas and Upanishads. As
the political and all other problems of the world remain unsolved despite a
dedicated group of intellectuals debating over the solutions over golden water,
so will the Vedas and Upanishads fail to impact the society. At the heart of all
this lies the one common cause - no action, all fashion!</p>
