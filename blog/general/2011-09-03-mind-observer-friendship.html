    <h2>The Mind of an Observer of Friendship</h2>
    <span class="date"> Saturday, 03 September, 2011</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>Warning: The article has been written a long time back in a state of extremely
pessimistic observation of the things around me. It does not necessarily reflect
my rational most observation. Hence the title contains "an observer..." meaning
the article is from the point of view of one of many observers.</p>
<p>How many times has it happened that you wake up in the morning and naively get
ready for the day only to discover later that you are going to meet someone who
will become a close friend of yours? It happens to many people many a times. The
day all seems ordinary and humble but you get introduced to a person with whom
you strike a chord. Friendship forms and it brings about a positive change in
your life. For the first few days, every day seems like a special one with time
spent in bonding with a new found friend and feeling the excitement of having
found someone who resonates with your inner being.</p>
<p>And a couple of months or maybe years later, you wake up to find that excitement
gone. That certain thrill you used to feel on meeting that person just
disappears. That exuberant show of affection has been replaced with a blank and
a blunt outward look. Those were the good old days when the new found joy could
have disappeared easily and thus care was exercised to preserve it. So intense
was the care taken to preserve this new found friendship that you show affection
at every chance you get, you show immeasurable tolerance when needed and show
flexibility that borders being comparable to a rubber.</p>
<p>This mind somehow feels no remorse when letting go of someone with whom you have
spent only a couple of days. But the mind apparently has a problem abandoning
someone who has been around for a very long time. But when the mind and the
heart desire someone who has been around for a couple of days to be around for a
very long time, efforts come out quite effortlessly. A passionate show of
affection, care and concern. A strong exercise of self control to tolerate the
fallacies of the person in front coming out of fear that a loss of temper for an
occassional trivial reason should not destroy the long term prospects.</p>
<p>And a couple of years later, something seems to have changed. Like a tree that
has now firm roots and hence is capable of tolerating some blows given to it,
the friendship has become immune to mild friction. The participants have no
hesitation in screaming out their views. They feel no need to show intense
affection. They take liberties they would not have dare taken couple of years
earlier. The careful precision and the watchful eye that scouted for the
smallest of needs of the other seems no longer a necessity. Everything that had
to be said has been said and it feels like nothing else can be said. Time is
spent in looking at each other but no words flow.</p>
<p>Probably, the heart in its state of missing a lot many emotions so cherishable
takes over the mind. Irrational actions become common. The point of focus shifts
from the outside to the inside. The necessity of checking this shift is not
felt. Why would it? The focus used to be outside for a purpose and the purpose
has been achieved, the other person is not going to let you go in one snap just
because the focus is off him or her! But when the focus which you could feel
upon yourself is gone, it carves out a hollow in the heart. Now, we have two
hollowed hearts instead of one. The first hollow emerged when it focussed on
itself and the second hollow emerged when the focus could no longer be felt!</p>
<p>What can two hollow hearts do but to bleed? And so they bleed. The famous cycle
of friendship is set in motion. From an initial excitement to neutrality and now
has emerged the negative phase. A time of chaos and misunderstanding. A time
when negative energy spreads engulfing all in a state of misery. The hollowed
hearts get hollower and hollower. And finally comes a decisive time where the
either the desire to eradicate the source of hollowness appears or the desire to
fill the hollowness appears. When the former happens, relationships break. The
two people part their ways perhaps never to see each other again. But when the
latter happens, the two people are filled with the urge to fill the hollow and
make their friendship full again. But the process is too slow. The hollowed
hearts must first fill. Then they must rise. Why is this such a common story, to
me is something quite amusing and amazing!</p>
