    <h2>The Exceptional</h2>
    <span class="date"> Sunday, 04 September, 2011</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>Exceptions are dangerous when looked at individually. To elaborate on this
statement, a question we can ask ourselves is the following – how did the first
of the laws of Nature or the laws of economics or any other law get discovered?
Laws are discovered by statistical patterns in our “data set”. Having found a
pattern, we occasionally find something deviating systematically from this
pattern and then in our process of explaining the deviation, make our
understanding of the law more subtle. Imagine ourselves formulating the laws
based on a few exceptional elements. It should be quite dangerous. I want to
dedicate this piece of my writing to all those poor people coming from outside
our country who formulate preconceptions about our country based on the data
available to them!</p>
<p>Whenever some bold representative of our country makes a mark in the
international arena, the whole country acting under the action of the generous
press join in celebration of the mark made. The adrenaline is high and so are
the levels of pride especially when the world is appreciating us. These
exceptional people who make their marks always show a culture that in turn is
exceptional. But from a country of vast millions of people, whom do we blame for
making popular only the most exceptional people? Nobody! It is obvious that only
the exceptional are talked about and usually the exceptional have exceptional
cultures. And since these exceptions are all that a man not of our own kin can
watch, he forms a preconception of us based on these exceptions and in the rush
of things, decides to come and see the masses!</p>
<p>The visitor stands on a street side of a decent locality of one of our cities.
He is possibly waiting for one of our decent buses or cab to pick him up. Around
he turns and notices the corners of all railings stained by rust. He soon
realizes that it is not rust! And neither is it red oxide. It is but the
byproduct of the typical man’s uncontrollable desire to chew tobacco leaves and
spit the juice out wherever he goes! And thus the first shock. He then notices a
man gargling on the street, a man spitting on the road side and another
littering. With an expanded data set, he realizes that all his preconceptions
are breaking apart!</p>
<p>He thinks that the torture is over when the bus finally arrives but he is so
very wrong. Somebody told him that our country was making so much progress that
every other man in the city was having a cell phone. But what he was not told is
that the people do not know how to use an ear phone or control the volume of the
built-in MP3 player. His entire bus journey is a tormenting experience as he is
caught in the middle of the “battle of the volumes” wherein people attempt
playing their favorite music louder than the other person. He consoles himself
that what he had seen was a local phenomenon. He is therefore a bit optimistic
about the train journey that he has to take.</p>
<p>It’s the same story on the train as well. But there are a few additions. He has
caught a night train and has the naïve expectation that people on the train
would have their dinners already. He then notices people taking out big boxes
full of food. The people spend their time carelessly sharing their food within
the group dropping some of it on the berths and some on the floor. Of course,
that is bound to happen. But what is even more shocking is the callousness that
follows. The food on the floor is left as it is. The food on the berths is just
wiped out in the most ineffective manner! I shall spare the reader the trouble
he will undergo when he walks into the toilet!</p>
<p>The country is developing! The country is developing! Why? How? Are you saying
this because every second person you see in the city has a cell phone? Or it
because the number of medals we won in the recent games is quite a large one? Or
it is because some scientist got some international recognition recently? Or is
it because you received an e-mail that talks about how your Prime Minister is
possibly among the most academically qualified in the world? These are
individual achievements but where is the collective culture that can be the true
indicator of the overall development of the nation? How fair is it to measure
the development of a nation by measuring the qualities of the Exceptional?</p>
