    <h2>Apples and Oranges</h2>
    <span class="date"> Sunday, 04 March, 2012</span>

    <br/>

    <p>I am going to talk about things in this post which are very obvious to most
people but nonetheless I am going to talk about it and you are going to read it
(hopefully!) and at the end of the day, nothing will change. Despite knowing
this, I write this post simply because I need to get it out of my mind. As many
of you would have guessed, “apples and oranges” is a phrase that is frequently
used to describe a situation where people compare two things that should
actually not be compared too seriously. The origin of this phrase, I heard, but
I can't be sure, stems from Physics books which tell you that you cannot add two
quantities that are not of the same dimension i.e. you cannot add apples to
oranges, weight to height and so on. There are many instances where people tend
to add apples to oranges anyway, but I am going to cover something very specific
in this post. This post will be regarding movies and novels.</p>
<p>Very often I have heard people after seeing a movie based on a novel, “The movie
is not as good as the novel.” Time and now, I have heard this statement and
learned to ignore it. But time and now, it has also bewildered me considerably.
There was a time when I was very callous in the use of my words when criticising
someone who is unable to play the guitar or some instrument the way it should be
played. But when I took a shot at learning an instrument myself, I realized how
painful and difficult it is! Since then, I choose to criticise something that
does not appeal to me but I choose my words more carefully because somewhere I
have learned to respect whatever hard work and dedication the man would have put
to at least take a crack at it. This tendency of mine to think about the
difficulties involved; I have generalized it to many walks of life.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something which is obvious. When an author writes a book, he
does not have to think twice before adding another page. If a few lines can take
the depth of some particular segment to a whole new level, well, he simply adds
them! He weaves a plot with two central characters and maybe just in 2 pages,
realizes that the plot could be modified to contain 3 more characters! What does
he do? No problem! He will add the three characters. It should be obvious that
if he meant to write a 500 page novel with 2 lead characters, maybe with 3 more
characters, his novel is going to become an 800 page novel! What does he do?
Well, no problem – he will add the three hundred pages with ease. The novelist
is now writing the 600th page of his book and he feels that somewhere there is a
loop hole in the plot. He suspends his writing and then thinks about a better
way of presenting a particular part which allows him to take care of the
discovered loophole. He probably goes and makes a change in the 413th page, then
another play of words in the 499th page and done – the novel reads much better
now!</p>
<p>Let us now suppose that we have a movie producer who thinks this novel can
become a fantastic movie! Let us ask the primary question – can his script look
like a novel? Ah! He would then not be making a movie but a television series!
No, important things will have to be paid more attention and some things will
have to but cut off! But who makes the decisions? A screenplay writer and maybe
even the novelist is roped in to help out. Elements of plot, more central than
the others are chosen. Some characters have to be discarded. Along with the
characters, some story elements have to be discarded for consistency. When the
final script is prepared, the producer and the director go through it and they
might be saying exactly the same thing which you and I with our buttocks warm on
our sofas, would say, “Hmmm. This does not have that depth!” The movie maker ask
- “Hey, can we not bring that part in?” The screenplay writers say, “If you do
that, you also have to get that part in and this character and so on. The
screenplay would have to be expanded for 40 more minutes.” And needless to say,
in a movie, the cost can be measured as some hundreds or thousands of dollars
per second! Adding thirty minutes more is not going to be easy at all!</p>
<p>Finally, a script is approved. Actors have been casted. The crew has been
assembled. The locations have been chosen. The schedule has been designed. The
novel consists of a female lead who thinks and acts in a specific way. When I
read the novel, I am going to paint a picture for myself as to how this
character would look and behave if she were standing in front of me, in real
life. This is the tough part! You and I cannot agree on the interpretation! No
matter how great the director, somewhere the actress' perception and
understanding of the character will creep in the movie! Then there is another
problem – stereotyping. You may have seen this actress in another movie playing
an opposite kind of role and somehow, your emotional part of the brain does not
allow you to accept this actress playing this particular role whereas her
audition indicated the opposite to the director and producer.</p>
<p>As the movie is filmed, more problems may occur. Some elements may not work out
so well in the final cut and there is very little editing that you can do to
change things for the best. I cannot vouch for this but I am sure that many a
times the crew thinks - “Ah, we could have done this better...” Finally, the
movie is released. Mixed reactions, good and bad! “Bad” say the people who read
the novel. “Good / Not bad”, say the peeople who went with a clean slate, an
unbiased mind into the movie hall! And then comes my worst moment, sitting in
the corner of the sofa, sipping a drink casually and asking, “So, how is the
movie, any reviews?” and getting the usual reply, “Pathetic! The novel was way
better!” A nice one line summary for years of effort of trying to present the
story of a novel using a new challenging medium.</p>
<p>Let me make a few things very clear before signing off! I do not support the
extreme opinion that a movie based on a novel should not be criticised at all.
But its criticism should be done in a way that fits the category and not just a
one line summary comparing apples and oranges. Also, I clearly made the life of
a novelist look very smooth and easy in one of my above paragraphs. But my point
was not to say that a novelist has an easy job on his hands but has a clear
advantage that he is the sole master of the work he is producing, free from
restrictions and other problems – technical or non-technical, that plague the
other medium of telling a story. The whole idea was to contrast and compare the
conditions under which the two pieces of work are produced, thus making them, at
least in my opinion, apples and oranges! I dedicate this post to all the film
makers who have taken up the challenging task described above with whatever
success. My salutations to you for your efforts!</p>
