    <p>The Internet is full of memes. Some memes come and go, ridiculing or poking fun
of something or someone because of a media context. Then there are those memes
which are timeless, poking fun of something which is not really dependent on a
news item in the media. A commonly found set of memes aims at making fun of
managers and/or team leaders. One of the memes I distinctly remember is one
which shows a baby in a diaper with the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Managers are like diapers. Always behind your ass and always full of shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny, isn't it? Well, in the last two years, I have had a chance to wear the
hats of both a project manager as well as a team leader. Prior to this, I spent
six years locked up in a room either getting mentored occasionally or mentoring
occasionally, both of which are not too hard in comparison to the two roles I
just mentioned. Nothing could really prepare me for some of the challenges I
have faced and continue to face even today. The situation is made even worse by
the fact that in Indian academia, there does not seem to be any urgency to
institute training programs in fields of leadership, team and project
management.</p>
<p>I tried reading a couple of books as well as a bunch of articles on the Internet
to brace myself for the role but nothing really prepared me for the challenges.
I have come to believe that there is no book or article out there than can truly
prepare you - it is like swimming, no matter how much you read about it you
cannot learn until you have stepped into the pool and made an attempt to float.
And we all know how that works - the water in the nose, the gasping of the air,
the panic etc.</p>
<p>I believe there are two aspects of being a manager. One is the very art of
planning work allocation, setting timelines etc. This task is definitely not
easy and there is a plethora of books, articles and courses about this. There
are also several IT platforms which help in this task. Of course, experience
makes you better and efficient with this aspect of management but going through
formal training and courses can have a dramatic impact on how fast you learn
your lessons. In my case, I had no immediate access to these techniques and
tools and had to self-learn. One of these days, I intend to throw my own
personal money, find some nice workshop or course to attend and correct this
lack of formal knowledge.</p>
<p>The second aspect is the social aspect. Team members who refuse to change their
wrong habits and methods despite telling them patiently about why they should,
balancing between liberty/freedom of work method and technique vs imposing rules
/ micromanaging every activity, deciding when to raise your voice vs explaining
in a controlled manner, balancing needs of the project vs important needs or
emergencies faced by the members, giving up on the growth potential of a member
vs continuously chasing them to chase glory, trying to prevent staganancy among
people who choose to be stagnant, ensuring no single member feels singled out,
left out or treated unfairly, finding a way to award hard workers despite the
system putting constraints on how you can do so etc.</p>
<p>And a manager is seldom the king. The manager has someone on top of the food
chain to handle as well. And this person is unlikely to make things too easy
either. Here are some things I and a couple of other people I have interacted
with, have heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your team's failure is your failure.</p>
<p>I don't care how you do it, just make sure your team delivers on time.</p>
<p>I know you care about team motivation but we simply don't have the budget to
do this. You find another way to do it.</p>
<p>I understand why you wish to do this. But it is simply against our policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I repeat - I doubt if there is anything that can prepare anyone for these
challenges. If any of you are aware of a magic book, an instructional video or a
magical article which can achieve this, please do let me know. The one solution
I can imagine is for us to take advantage of platforms like MeetUp and organize
round-table discussions where managers from various industries can take turns in
explaining a certain situation or a challenge they had to face and allow
alternate solutions and views to pour in, something like a group therapy
session.</p>
<p>And because of this whole issue being complex, it is easy to fail as a manager
and a leader. It is easy to become known as a bad one, it is easy to fall into
the ranks of those managers who will never attract anything but criticism. Yes,
we have plenty of examples of good leaders and managers but remember that they
are famous because they did a great job. Those who took a shot at it or found
themselves forced in this situation and failed, will not be illustrated in the
books obviously. That of course does not mean that if you belong to such a
class, you shouldn't be making efforts to switch!</p>
<p>So, there it is! My small tribute to all those who find themselves in the
position of a manager or a leader. Kudos to you all! You have attempted
something indeed very mind boggling!</p>
