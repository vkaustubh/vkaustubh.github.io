    <h2>The Teacher - Student Full Circle</h2>

    <p>The last couple of years have been very interesting for me from the standpoint
of exploring the dynamics of the relationship between a student and a teacher.
The primary reason this whole dynamic has taken centre stage in my thought
process is because I have had a chance to become a teacher myself. For the first
time I have moved from partial sympathy for my teachers to full blown empathy
for them. In this post, I wish to share some realizations I have had and some
lessons that I have learned.</p>
<p>Let me start with the obvious activity of any teacher - teaching in a class
room. I am yet to take a full term or semester long course but already I am
beginning to appreciate how challenging things can be! Over the last few years,
I have had the chance to give a series of lectures on a specialized topic (like
python, git etc.). As someone who does not like to be perceived as someone who
does not understand what they are talking about, I generally spend extra hours
before each lecture ensuring that the flow is right, experimenting with
different flows until I am able to convince myself that a given flow is the best
way to present things. If I had a tough week when I gave a series of talks on a
particular topic, I am not sure what kind of time I would have preparing for an
entire semester long course. And I straight scared of what it might take to come
up with assignments and exams for student evaluation (I did not have to evaluate
students in any of my short courses!).</p>
<p>Of all the short courses I have given over the last few years, there are only
two occassions where I have really enjoyed speaking and felt a sense of
satisfaction. Given the total number of talks and short courses I have given,
the actual percentage is dismal. As someone who has been on the stage many a
times, let me tell you what scares me and what delights me! Let's start with the
scary part. I am extremely scared of blank faces, disinterested faces, a
complete lack of questions &amp; interactions, and an unpunctual crowd.</p>
<p>Blank faces do nothing to give me any motivation or confidence. Disinterested
faces make me feel like the person in the crowd has a gun held to their head and
have been threatened to attend the lecture (yes, those faces are most frequent
in those cases where I am giving guest lectures at colleges where teachers
actually think that a full house is a way of pleasing guest speakers and thus
threaten students with marks and attendance records!). Complete lack of
questions &amp; answers is dismal for me for a whole lot of reasons. When I say
complete, I mean truly complete. I completely sympathize that certain students
are unable to ask me any questions during the lecture because of some social
anxieties or whatever but if there are no questions during a following tea
break, then it becomes even more dismal. Another reason why questions are a
delight is because some of them help clarify my own understanding. And an even
bigger delight is when I am asked a question I hadn't even thought of - that is
a dream come true - gives me a chance to explore an angle and saves me from
saturation.</p>
<p>Unpunctual crowd is a very sensitive topic for me! If you have read my article
titled "Smart Technology is Here, Where are the Smart People", you will know
that I am very sensitive about people owning smart phones but not knowing how to
use them correctly. A talk is announced at 9.30 AM but the crowd starts entering
the hall at 9.30 AM! So, it takes 9.45 AM before the first word can be spoken!
Lot of people are desensitized about this and it has become a norm to "give a
five minutes grace period" for the late comers! I simply do not accept this and
I do not want to accept this! If I become known as an unreasonable guy who gives
trouble to people for not coming on time, so be it but I simply hate the ever
growing culture of people not understanding what "timings" mean.</p>
<p>At the end of every single talk, I find myself in the memory lane. Memories of
my teachers come back to me. The way they taught, the joy in their eyes while
teaching, the confusion, the hurt, the flying of the handle etc. Traces of anger
lurking in the corner of my mind for a teacher who may have scolded me for what
I'd believe was no fault of mine, disappear. I am filled with a new found sense
of respect for them. Don't get me wrong! I have always respected my teachers but
until you teach students, there is a certain sense of respect you can never
develop for them. It is almost akin to sons not respecting their fathers in a
certain special way until they become fathers themselves!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the content below, it might be helpful to mentally replace the word
'student' with 'intern', 'junior', 'employee' or any other word as required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other aspect of being a teacher is that of guiding and mentoring students in
short term and long term projects. Here again, my experience is very diverse.
From people who have gone on to become highly successful in their fields to
people who simply refuse to let go of nasty habits, I have seen both. I have
felt the shared joy of students hitting gold with fantastic opportunities to
students who made it amply clear that they didn't want the extra bit of pushing
I like to give, wanting them to truly grow.</p>
<p>My own philosophy is (or was?) that if I agree to be a mentor or a guide to
someone, I give in my hundred percent of available time and effort to doling out
advice which can help them truly grow. And growth for me is not only about
becoming better on a technical level but also growing as a professional. So,
students working under me should not only learn to become faster and better in
doing various things but also learn work ethics, respect, professionalism,
punctuality, organization etc. Here too I try to lead by example. But I have
found all ranges of response. I have had deluded brats who think there is
nothing left to learn and I have had perfectionists who have changed themselves
in every small way I may have asked them to.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone you mentored goes on to become very successful and reach
heights, one feels a sense of elation, joy and fulfillment. But an even bigger
prize is when they acknowledge you even with the smallest of gestures such as a
personalized visit to your work place with a box of sweets or even a thank-you
note. And then you have examples of people who either outright refuse to listen
to you as per their convenience or those who only superficially agree with you
and never translate their acknowledgement of any good advice received from you
into a developed habit.</p>
<p>The positive experiences have played an important role in my being able to
thwart away the pessimistic feelings or feelings of disappointment I may have
experienced because of the not-so-good lot. The negative experiences induce in
me many a times a mood of despair which says, "Why should I even bother?" And
slowly I find that a balanced approach would be to come up with methods of
vetting prospective students in specific ways to ensure they have a higher
chance of belonging to the "positive type". And the moment when this approach
first crossed my mind, I began to understand why some of my teachers in the past
have been careful and slow in agreeing to have me onboard.</p>
<p>And this way, slowly but surely I find myself completing the full circle of the
student - teacher relationship. My sincerest and deepest of gratitude to all my
teachers who have helped me along the way. I may have said this before but now I
am able to say it with a whole different conviction.</p>
