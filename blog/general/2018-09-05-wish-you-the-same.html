    <p>Another September 5th passes away. And one more time I sit back and muse on how
various teachers have played various important roles in shaping my thought
process. Apart from the usual musing, I have spent the morning writing out
emails to a few teachers with whom I share an exceptional bond, updating them of
my career progress and current projects. In recent years I have also experienced
the thrill of receiving the occasional mails or messages wishing me a Happy
Teacher's Day. It never fails to implant the thought of “how time flies”.</p>
<p>Usually when I receive such a message, I reply back, “Wish you the same.”
Generally I get a “huh smiley” or a grinning smiley as a reply. This time one of
my well wishers decided to make a statement - “I never understood this.” And the
short reply I gave him inspires me to pen down my thoughts on what I mean when I
say, “Wish you the same.”</p>
<p>I strongly believe that everyone is a teacher. We all teach each other some
lesson or the other whether we mean to do so or not. Sometimes we teach in a
more formal setting and earn the title of a teacher and the modern form of
adulation that comes with it but most times we teach through our actions, both
good and bad.</p>
<p>A few years back, someone I helped a bit with a few things, surprised me with an
email wishing me on this day, my first such greeting. Until then I had no idea
of how such a wish could bring such a warm and rewarding feeling to anyone. At
that instant this person became my teacher by inspiring me to take up this
tradition of sending out wishes to a few teachers. That is one of several
examples of how people have taught me valuable lessons in subtle ways.</p>
<p>In the past year there have been those people who have taught some amazing
lessons albeit by behaving in outrageously unacceptable manners. While a few
minutes to hours of grief is caused, the mind manages to draw some lessons from
this and manages to laugh off the time spent in grief and anguish.</p>
<p>I find my attempts to learn from everyone's actions, however minor, to not only
serve the purpose of helping me grow but also as being self psychotherapeutic!
So, thank you all!</p>
