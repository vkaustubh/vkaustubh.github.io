    <p>Here is a very quick explanation of what Machine Learning classifier models are!
You have some properties or qualities describing some object, whatever it may
be - and you have a large collection of such objects for which you know in
advance what category each belongs to. You take all these data and you feed it to
a special computer program and the program figures out the pattern that connects
the qualities of the object and the class to which they belong. Such a simple
Machine Learning program is called a classifier.</p>
<p>A simple classifier algorithm is capable of putting an object into only one
class. For example, it could either say that a fruit is pulpy or it is a mango
but not both. Hence I am liberally coining the term 'rigid' here to describe
this behavior. I'll use the word 'narrow' to describe the fact that the classifier
can only put an object in a class which it knows and is incapable of creating
new classes. This is the simplest classification algorithm a student just
starting to learn Machine Learning can write on the very first day itself. It is
meant to very rudimentarily mimic the learning done by a human brain.</p>
<p>With that explanation out of the way, let me get to the topic I really want to
talk about and how it connects with all the above technicalities!</p>
<p>I find an increasingly rampant social phenomenon around me. And it is very
alarming and I believe it has the potential to decay the lubricants which keep our
social machinery going smoothly. During a casual conversation, I might take the
name of a certain individual known to appear on Youtube and other media. I
compliment the person for the overall lucidity with which he speaks and the
crispness with which he answers most questions. That individual is labelled as a
mystic and all of a sudden I am being labelled as a follower of the mystic arts.</p>
<p>On another occassion, I find myself siding with an individual for saying certain
things which sound right to me but that individual might be what the society
calls an extreme right wing fanatic. And now I am labelled as a right wing
fanatic. At some point people assume I am at some location in this whole mysterious
spectrum of left - right (which I never understood!) and I compliment another
person's statement who is on the other side of the spectrum. And now I'm being
labelled as a hypocrite who changes sides.</p>
<p>If I declare I don't believe in a Personal Creator God, I am labelled as an
atheist and if under that label I go and quote a religious text, I am labelled a
hypocrite or maybe mad. If I declare I am not religious and one day I am found
in a temple seated peacefully, immediately the narrow rigid classifiers of the
human race (hopefully a small section of the human race) start executing their
program and begin to classify me!</p>
<p>Do I have to declare myself in one of your narrow classes and then forever
constrain my behavior according to the statistical average behavior of all the
people in that class? Can't I, in the process of exploring this amazing thing
called life, hop from one point of view to another because of new
information and understanding that has come to dawn on me? Why can't you all just
accept growing is a part of moving from one state to another and never accepting
any state as the final and correct one?</p>
<p>Why can't you look back at yourself in time and see how you have changed? If you
had some views long time ago and your views are now different, can't you simply
accept that tomorrow you will have another point of view and be looking back in
time at a stranger? Why do you have to hold someone against something they said
at some point of time and not realize that they are capable redacting part or
all of their statements?</p>
<p>Why is a statement bad because the person who said it, is bad? Why is a statement
not acceptable because it comes from a text written by someone whose views you
don't agree with? Why do I have to be a binary classifier who chooses to either
accept an entire collection of ideas or reject them? Why can't I pick a good
idea from an otherwise atrocious collection of ideas? Why can't I call something
good despite one of thousand entities being associated with it being bad? Why
can't I compliment an otherwise bad person for saying or doing something good?
Why can't ideas live by themselves - why do they have to be attached to people
or sects and be denied of objective evaluation forever by people who don't
identify themselves with those people or sects?</p>
<p>The rigid narrow classifier as I called it, is considered to be a first
approximation of the otherwise <strong><em>still far from being fully understood</em></strong> human brain.
Then why are we abandoning the full potential of the human mind and mimicking
those learning models which were the first steps towards trying to mimic us?</p>
