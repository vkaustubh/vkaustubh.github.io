    <h2>A Killer Named Anxiety</h2>
    <span class="date"> Friday, 01 May, 2020</span>
    <div></div>
    <br/>

    <p>Imagine you are a hunter-gatherer of what might be largely considered a long
lost past. You are walking through a forest and there is a rustling of the
leaves. Millions of years of evolution have made you sharp to this particular
sound. While the sound may be caused by the wind blowing through the leaves, it
can also be caused by a predator hunting for its prey - you! You become
immediately alert and your breathing slows down. You have not had food for days
and are on the way to forage for some when you hear this rustling of leaves.</p>
<p>You know the difference between the rustling of the leaves caused by the wind
and the rustling caused by a predator moving stealthily towards its prey. Your
mind, already a little anxious now, begins to watch out for further signs.
Slowly, the breathing of the predator and its footsteps become more apparent.
And instinctively you turn your eyes towards a particular direction and find
yourself staring at a wolf! Then something truly magical happens! Despite having
not eaten decent food for days, a rush of energy comes in and you start running
towards safety. Where did your energy come from?</p>
<h3>Meet Cortisol</h3>
<p>Cortisol is a naturally occurring hormone in your body. And when faced with
danger or the notion of danger, your body's balanced production of cortisol goes
out for a toss and your levels of cortisol rise. These elevated levels of
cortisol divert the focus of your body towards processing your reserve stores of
energy and making them available. It is by this availability of energy (blood
glucose) that you are able to find a sudden source of energy which allows your
'fight or flight' response.</p>
<p>And thank goodness this happens! Else in the slightest face of danger we would
continue to gallop around like idiots and any predator, animate or inanimate,
will have us where it wants and we wouldn't survive too long. But good things
are good only if they come at the right place and at the right time. An
unseasonal rain might be a welcome sight but can wreck havoc on the delicate
balance of nature. Same way, imagine that your levels of cortisol were always
elevated! What would happen?</p>
<p>When cortisol kicks into action, it completely changes the priorities of your
body. It may slow down your digestive processes, your growth and healing
processes and may even compromise your immune system. The focus is on giving you
enough energy to escape the situation. But imagine there is no situation. Then
not only is your body being denied a healthy occurrence of various processes but
you are not 'fighting or flighting' and using these excess energy. We call it
'high sugar' in our casual conversations.</p>
<p>Some people suffer from disorders such as Cushing's Syndrome aka
hypercortisolism. They are doomed to suffer its consequences unless medical
intervention is available. But there are those among us who are voluntarily
submitting to a condition of elevated cortisol and its associated problems.</p>
<h3>Meet High Cortisol's Modern Friends</h3>
<p>Are you anxious? Er ... no, you might say, giving a broad convincing smile. Are
you sure? Oh ... of course, comes the reply. And then you glance over to your
side where your phone has been kept. No sooner had the waiter brought your
exotic dish than you had taken a photograph of it and uploaded it to your
Facebook wall, and sent it out to your Whatsapp friends. The LED on the top of
the phone which starts glowing when a new notification has arrived, is not
blinking.</p>
<p>You turn your gaze and look at your friend again with whom you are having lunch.
A few moments later, you are looking again at your phone. You cannot resist and
you quickly grab your phone and open Whatsapp. A double blue tick on your close
friend's chat window. She has read your message! Strange. Why hasn't she
replied? What could be wrong? Ah, what about your other friend? A double grey
tick - she still hasn't seen the message. Hmmm! Ok. Another friend, double blue
and no reply! What? Why?</p>
<p>You turn back to your friend and he is not at all pleased. He is meeting you
after such a long time and here you are, more anxious about potential comments
from your friends over a picture you took of a dish. The conversation turns sour
and dull. Your friend quickly wraps up the lunch and then excuses himself for
wanting to go elsewhere for another appointment. You feel bad, of course, since
you are in general a good human being and also completely aware that your friend
is a little upset. You come back home with a double dose of worries and in that
trance fail to ackowledge your waiting parents who are eager to share something
with you. Now they are upset and the chain goes on!</p>
<p><strong>This is self-inflicted hypercortisolism!</strong></p>
<p>It's bad enough that modern work places are sources of stress and anxiety and
here you have to inflict more on yourself. And if you think this is not messing
up your levels of cortisol, think again. And then ask yourself - what kind of an
idiot inflicts such a condition on one's body? Well, then stare at yourself in
the mirror and hope that you are not that idiot.</p>
<h3>Personal Suggestions for Escaping Self Inflicted Hypercortisolism</h3>
<p>There are obvious solutions in the form of exercise and Yoga. These physical
activities help manage cortisol levels as well as the associated changes
produced in the body because of elevated levels of cortisol. But here are my
personal suggestions apart from obvious.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Guided meditation in the middle of the action. Plenty of podcasts, Youtube
  videos and apps exist which provide guided meditations of various lengths. Try
  to find a quiet place and do these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tomato meters! The <strong>Pomodoro</strong> technique suggests slicing your day in cycles
  of 25 minute bursts of non-distracted work followed by mandatory 5 minute
  breaks. I follow this less for productivity but more for the mandatory breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shutting down the Internet on the phone for prolonged periods on specific
  days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a real hobby to pursue during free times. If you love it, following the
  previous idea becomes trivial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable mobile data when meeting up with real people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet more real people and invest more time with them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are many more methods out there. But to provide an exhaustive
list is not the intention of this post. This post is to bring out the severe
danger that lies in self inflicted stress and the necessity to acknowledge its
presence. Once acknowledged, it becomes easier to solve the problem. Beware of
the killer named anxiety!</p>
