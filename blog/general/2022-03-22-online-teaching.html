    <h2>Online Teaching</h2>

    <br/>

    <p>Very recently, I was contacted by a representative from one of the many
corporations (I hate to call them education providers) and asked if I would be
willing to take classes for their students on an adhoc basic on weekends. I love
teaching and consider it an honorable profession. Unsurprisingly, I agreed to
discuss the opportunity further. The academic panel wanted a demonstration of my
abilities to teach and I was more than happy to point them to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoEVLTc-svA">long 1.5 hour
lecture</a> that I gave to a mixed
audience on probability distributions. Without wasting much time, they came back
to me and observed that in this video, I have addressed a live audience and used a
whiteboard whereas I would be expected to teach students online and use digital
tools.</p>
<p>This should have been first alarm bell but I indulged them and gave them a fresh
recording on a mutually decided topic. They took their own sweet time and came
back to me with a feedback modeled using the classical "good news first, bad
news later" approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The good news was that my communication skills were excellent. That my
  understanding of the subject was good. That my use of annotations was good
  too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then they delivered the bad news - I was not engaging the audience enough
  (in a demo recording!!!), I was not using graphics (yes, student imagination
  is not to be pushed, everything must be illustrated with modern graphics), I
  was not conducting random polls (yes, it gives the students a much needed break
  every few minutes after they have become very tired) and I was not providing
  any use cases (why would I spill all my beans in a demo recording with no
  contract of how the recording itself will be used).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There was an audacious suggestion that I agree to recording or performing
another demo session. My reply to them made the following very clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I would not do another demo session. If an academic panel made of IITians and
  IIMians was not able to judge my teaching abilities based on two recorded
  sessions, then it was not worth providing more evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that when it comes to methods of engagement, we would have to agree to
  disagree. Most great teachers do not use graphics, do not use polls and do not
  use pop quizzes in the middle of the lectures. My style of teaching makes a
  student feel as if they are a part of a classroom where a real teacher is
  standing in front of them and they are being taken through a journey. Students
  have praised me considerably for this refreshing method of teaching that
  breaks the (what I believe are stupid) norms of massive online teaching
  models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That my students have never complained of being disengaged and this was a fact
  that could not be demonstrated in a recorded session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure enough, there was a polite acknowledgement but I have not heard anything
back from them. And I guess I don't want to! The whole incident made me think of
the best lecturers whose magic I was lucky enough to witness. In some cases,
these teachers stood at the blackboard with no notes and just a chalk in their
hand. And then they weaved the most engrossing of narratives which kept us
hooked for not ten minutes but hours and hours. We forgot our thirst, we forgot
our hunger and we forgot time!</p>
<p>This state where the mind enters a trance and does some real learning has been
recognized in brain studies and has in fact been given a name - it is called the
"flow state". And only people who are absorbed in what they do, with sufficient
depth, can alone realize this state and use the full power of their brains in
crafting ideas and learning things in depth. And guess what modern teaching is
doing - it is going in the opposite direction! Just look at some of the rules
that have been written by someone for designing online courses - keep videos
shorter than 10 minutes, conduct many pop quizzes, show lots of animations and
graphics and give plenty of examples. How can someone enter that state of flow
and do real deep learning if we are going to be constantly bombarded by
interruptions?</p>
<p>When I expressed this view to some people, they pointed out to me that perhaps
there is no market for such teachers which is why the corporations offering
these MOOCs have adopted this model. I am not sure what to make of this. But I
have plently of students who wish to hear more of what I have to say precisely
because of the classical approach that I take! But yes, we could still argue
that these students are in minority and that majority of the students who will
eventually give their money to the corporations, don't care about this kind of
deep study. And to this, I have only one thing to say - may God save their
souls!</p>
<p>Another argument that was presented is - these corporations need to give jobs.
And jobs require practical knowledge. And practical knowledge, for it to be
imparted properly, perhaps requires this kind of method of teaching. Again, a
very interesting point but my counter to this is simple - don't people who learn the
classical way get a job? In fact I would argue that the top most jobs are
reserved for these people! Because it is not the sole purpose of the teacher to
present information to a student. A higher purpose is to teach students how to
think. And the engineering of our brain can only happen if it is deeply
involved in the teaching and learning process.</p>
<p>I have witnessed the magical web being weaved by many teachers. And all teachers
known for this magic had one thing in common - their ability to dilate time,
their ability to inspire, their ability to touch the students at a sub-conscious
level, their ability to reengineer the thought process of the students. And it
is from this very fine cadre of magicians that I try and learn how to perform
the magic myself. And it leaves me with such immense satisfaction that I will
never hesitate in saying no to corporations that do not recognize this ability
or the students who can't value it!</p>
<p>Happy learning! Happy teaching!</p>
