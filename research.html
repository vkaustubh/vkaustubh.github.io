<h2 id="s0-galaxies">S0 Galaxies</h2>
<p>Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, what we like to call ‘morphologies’. What
shapes these galaxies? How are the different shapes related to each other? Do
galaxies tend to start out in one shape and move towards another? These are the
outstanding questions in galaxies which have not been answered fully despite
decades of research. When we see galaxies in the nearby Universe, trying to
arrange them in a sensible manner is a first step towards understanding them.
The famous astronomer, Edwin Hubble, was the first to try and come up with such
an arrangement and his effort is captured in the diagram below known as the
<em>tuning fork diagram</em>.</p>

<p><img class="linkedin" src="/static/images/hubble.png" alt="Hubble Tuning Fork" /></p>

<p>The elliptical galaxies lie towards the left and generally comprise of a single
component of stars i.e. all the stars appear to be a part of the same
ellipsoidal shaped collection. The galaxies towards the right are called spirals
and contain multiple components of stars. One group of stars form what appears
to be a spherical structure, known as the bulge while another group forms a
flattened structure, known as the disk. In this disk, one can find beautiful
spiral patterns. Now, imagine a similar structure containing a bulge and a disk
but without the spiral patterns i.e. a ‘plain disk’ - such a galaxy is called an
S0 galaxy or a lenticular galaxy.</p>

<p>The S0 galaxies lie at the junction of the tuning fork because it was envisioned
as some kind of a transition object between ellipticals and spirals. But does
this diagram paint the correct picture for S0 galaxies from the point of view of
their formation and their inter-relationships with other galaxies? Research
seems to suggest - no! So, what exactly are S0s? Are they all alike? How do they
form? These are the kind of questions I have tried to answer in my PhD research.

<h2 id="virtual-observatory">Virtual Observatory</h2>

<p>Modern astronomy is a very data intensive science. This means a lot of the
progress in Astronomy can be made only by increasing the mastery over the data.
But mastery over data is not an easy task. Imagine a world of yester-years where
every single observatory around the world used its own formats, its own methods
of analysis, its own methods of storing and labelling the data and its own way
of presenting the data to the world (after having published as much science from
it as possible, of course!). Such a world would be highly chaotic! Every time an
astronomer wants a different type of data on a given object, he/she would have
to spend immense time just understanding the interfaces, the formats etc.</p>

<p>Enter Virtual Observatory as a solution. It is not a simulated telescope, like
some are led to believe when they hear the term. Instead, it is a collection of
standards and protocols. And no, it is not an imposition on people to abandon
their custom solutions for data storage and service. It is instead a collection
of simple nomenclatures, descriptions, methods of serving data etc. that data
providers can adopt that makes their data searchable from a central registry.
So, Virtual Observatory acts as a very powerful, efficient interface between the
users and the data repositories, allowing users to use simple tools which can
search and acquire the data users are looking for. The existence of standards
also means that the developers of tools for analysis of astronomical data can
work independently with minimal coordination, so long as they keep themselves
well versed with the standards of how data can be described and exchanged.</p>

<p>For more details, you can visit the official <a href="http://www.ivoa.net">IVOA web
page</a>. There is a dedicated site for <a href="http://voi.iucaa.in">Indian Chapter of
VO</a>. My contributions to the Virtual Observatory project
include
* testing and development of <a href="http://voi.iucaa.in/voi/AstroStat.html">AstroStat</a>
* education and outreach
* beta-testing of tools such as IRIS.</p>

<h2 id="variability-estimation-and-counterpart-search">Variability Estimation and Counterpart Search</h2>

<p>Several astrophysical objects in the sky actually change their properties as a
function of time. The simplest property whose behavior in time can be studied is
the brightness of the object. This is what we call the variability of the
object. So, how do you know if a source is varying with time? Simple, you
measure its brightness at a time ‘t1’ and then again at a time ‘t2’. If the two
brightness measurements are different, we know that the object is varying …
well - no! One needs to understand that the source brightness will appear to
vary even if it is actually not. This is because of both the noise in our
measurements and noise in the source as well. So, our rather simple task of
determing whether an object varies, becomes a complex one. We need to be able to
differentiate between actual variability of the source and what appears to be
variability because of noise. I’m involved in a group studying methods by which
this can be done.</p>

<p>Eventually, one would like to employ such methods in <em>counterpart searches</em>.
X-ray telescopes typically have large positional uncertainties. This means that
it is possible for several objects to be in what is the most likely region from
which an X-ray emission was observed. The actual object which emits the X-rays
is known as the counterpart and determining the most likely counterpart for a
given X-ray source is an interesting problem in Astronomy.</p>
