<p>The purpose of the page is to share resources, particularly notes and documents
authored by me that may prove to be useful for someone other than myself. Please
feel free to give feedback and suggestions for content improvement. I must
state, for sake of clarity, that this page is currently meant to share resources
whose existence has been possible by my contribution in some way or the other.
If you do find the material on this web site useful, it’d be nice if you can
drop me a line at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#107;&#097;&#117;&#115;&#116;&#117;&#098;&#104;&#064;&#105;&#117;&#099;&#097;&#097;&#046;&#101;&#114;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#046;&#105;&#110;">this address</a>. It’d go a long
way in encouraging me to share more. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="image-reduction-and-analysis-facility">Image Reduction and Analysis Facility</h2>
<p>I have been teaching IRAF to Master’s level and PhD students for quite some
time now. Recently, I realized that oral instructions can be too slow for or
too fast for a mixed audience. So I decided to construct a written tutorial to
help beginners get a feel for working with IRAF. The tutorials of course
assume that you have somehow gotten help and installed IRAF already. Once you
have done that, you can follow these tutorials to get started.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_Intro.pdf">Introduction to IRAF</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_BasicRed.pdf">Basic CCD Reduction with IRAF</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_QuickPhot.pdf">Quick Look Aperture Photometry with IRAF</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="python-training">Python Training</h2>
<p><strong>Table Management in Python</strong> - Some self written notes casted in the form a PDF
document on the modules “asciitable” and “atpy” in Python. Part 1 of the
document is <a href="/static/files/Tablemanagement.pdf">here</a> and the part 2 is 
<a href="/static/files/Tablemanagement2.pdf">here</a>.  (Added - May 23rd, 2013) (Revision -
Aesthetics, Typos - July 14th, 2013) (WARNING: These modules are no longer
developed. Either ‘pandas’ or ‘astropy’ should now be used.)</p>

<p>There was a workshop on Python Programming conducted in IUCAA during February
17th - 21st, 2014. I delivered two back-to-back talks covering the basics of
Python. And also a talk on managing tables in Python using the AstroPy module.
The PDF versions of these talks are available at the following links.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/BasicPython_1.pdf">Basics of Python - 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/BasicPython_2.pdf">Basics of Python - 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/Tables_in_Python.pdf">Table Management in Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There was a workshop, again on Python programming, but this time organized by
the faculty at IIST, Trivandrum. Apart from the talks I gave last time (see
below for the IUCAA workshop resources), I gave the following additional talks
as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/AdvPython.pdf">More Python - Functions and Modules</a>
(some overlapping material Basics of Python - 2 given above)</li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/othertopics.pdf">Other Topics in Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/astropy.pdf">Astropy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By popular demand, me and Prof. Yogesh Wadadekar from NCRA, gave a series of
lectures on Python programming. The material is the same as the other
workshops mentioned below with one exception that the course has a <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in:8081/~yogesh/python2014/">dedicated
web page</a> 
with links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogeshw/videos">Youtube videos</a> 
where the recordings of the lectures may be found.</p>

<h2 id="an-astro-ubuntu">An Astro-Ubuntu</h2>
<p>I have managed to modify the original ISO of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to have
astronomical software such as IRAF, PyRAF, Python, iPython, astrometry.net and
also some astronomy related libraries within Python. Please note that I am not
a professional and so the ISO image is yours <strong><em>to try without any assurances</em></strong>.
Instructions on how use the image can be <a href="http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~kaustubh/resources/KOS.txt">obtained here</a>.</p>
