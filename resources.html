<p>
    Recently, I gave a lecture title <em> Using Simulations to Understand
        Chi-Square Statistics and Confidence Intervals </em> at the Centre for
    Modeling and Simulations (CMS), at SPPU. While most of the lecture involved
    the use of the dying art of writing on the board, I used a Jupyter notebook
    to demonstrate some simple simulations that could be used to understand some
    concepts related to chi-square statistics.
</p>

<p>The Jupyter notebook, the requirements.txt file and the custom fitting module
used in this lecture <a href="static/files/cms_lecture.zip">can be found here.</a></p>

<h2 id="python-training">Python Training</h2>

<p> My most recent teaching spree was in February, 2017 in a workshop titled
    <a href="http://www.iucaa.in:8080/Workshops/DIS2016/index.jsp"> <em>
            Workshop on Data Intensive Science </em> </a> jointly conducted by
    IUCAA and Persistent Systems Ltd. The workshop covered Python, Astropy,
    Machine Learning, databases etc. All shared resources can be found <a
        href="https://github.com/vkaustubh/DIS2016"> at this Github repository
    </a>. Unlike all other resources shared below, these new tutorials
    exclusively use Python 3. Unless you have a special reason, this is the
    Python one must use! </p>

<p><strong>Table Management in Python</strong> - Some self written notes casted in the form a PDF
document on the modules “asciitable” and “atpy” in Python. Part 1 of the
document is <a href="/static/files/Tablemanagement.pdf">here</a> and the part 2 is 
<a href="/static/files/Tablemanagement2.pdf">here</a>.  (Added - May 23rd, 2013) (Revision -
Aesthetics, Typos - July 14th, 2013) (WARNING: These modules are no longer
developed. Either ‘pandas’ or ‘astropy’ should now be used.)</p>

<p>There was a workshop on Python Programming conducted in IUCAA during February
17th - 21st, 2014. I delivered two back-to-back talks covering the basics of
Python. And also a talk on managing tables in Python using the AstroPy module.
The PDF versions of these talks are available at the following links.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/BasicPython_1.pdf">Basics of Python - 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/BasicPython_2.pdf">Basics of Python - 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/Tables_in_Python.pdf">Table Management in Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There was a workshop, again on Python programming, but this time organized by
the faculty at IIST, Trivandrum. Apart from the talks I gave last time (see
below for the IUCAA workshop resources), I gave the following additional talks
as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/AdvPython.pdf">More Python - Functions and Modules</a>
(some overlapping material Basics of Python - 2 given above)</li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/othertopics.pdf">Other Topics in Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/astropy.pdf">Astropy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By popular demand, me and Prof. Yogesh Wadadekar from NCRA, gave a series of
lectures on Python programming. The material is the same as the other
workshops mentioned below with one exception that the course has a <a href="http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in:8081/~yogesh/python2014/">dedicated
web page</a> 
with links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogeshw/videos">Youtube videos</a> 
where the recordings of the lectures may be found.</p>

<h2 id="image-reduction-and-analysis-facility">Image Reduction and Analysis Facility</h2>
<p>I have been teaching IRAF to Master’s level and PhD students for quite some
time now. Recently, I realized that oral instructions can be too slow for or
too fast for a mixed audience. So I decided to construct a written tutorial to
help beginners get a feel for working with IRAF. The tutorials of course
assume that you have somehow gotten help and installed IRAF already. Once you
have done that, you can follow these tutorials to get started.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_Intro.pdf">Introduction to IRAF</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_BasicRed.pdf">Basic CCD Reduction with IRAF</a></li>
  <li><a href="/static/files/IRAF_QuickPhot.pdf">Quick Look Aperture Photometry with IRAF</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="an-astro-ubuntu">An Astro-Ubuntu</h2>
<p>I have managed to modify the original ISO of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to have
astronomical software such as IRAF, PyRAF, Python, iPython, astrometry.net and
also some astronomy related libraries within Python. Please note that I am not
a professional and so the ISO image is yours <strong><em>to try without any assurances</em></strong>.
Instructions on how use the image can be <a href="http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/~kaustubh/resources/KOS.txt">obtained here</a>.</p>
