<h1 id="table-of-contents"> My Thesis - a Popular Level Summary</h1>

<h2 id="s0-galaxies">S0 Galaxies</h2>
<p> Just the way atoms or molecules can be considered as the basic building
blocks of the material around us, when we see the Universe on a large scale,
galaxies can be viewed as it's basic building blocks </p>

<p> These galaxies come in a variety of shapes as shown on the diagram below.
How these different galaxies are related to each other is very important to
understand the overall history of formation of our Universe. A very specific
class of galaxies is known as the S0 class. Consider the spiral galaxies on the
right of the diagram below. This has two main components in general - a central
structure we call bulge and an extended flat structure called the disk. S0
galaxies are spirals but without the spiral arms. Hence the 0! Did these S0s
come from ellipticals? Are they transformed spirals? Or are they something
unrelated? Or a combination of these? These were the questions that drove my
thesis research.</p>

<p><img class="linkedin" src="static/images/hubble.png" alt="Hubble Tuning Fork" /></p>

<h2>A Photometric Study</h2>

<p>An image of a galaxy tells us about the possible patterns in the brightness
distribution of the galaxy. One can then find mathematical functions which can
be used to describe the brightness distribution. Every such function is
characterized by some parameters.</p>

<p>Now, suppose I collection 100s of galaxies and model each galaxy's image, I'd
get the set of model parameters for each galaxy. A statistical analysis of all
these 100s of model parameters reveals a tight relationship between them. One
can then invoke the laws of Physics to understand under what conditions such
relationships can exist. This allows us to infer the physics of these galaxies
though as of now, we cannot even hope to reach and inspect these objects!</p>

<p>A major part of thesis involved painfully collecting data obtained from the
Spitzer Space telescope, processing these data, cleaning it up &amp; modelling
their light or brightness distribution. After this painful process, I leveraged
statistical tools to find relationships. This allowed me to constrain which
formation process is most likely responsible for a specific class of S0
galaxies.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, what I inferred was that this special subset of S0 galaxies were
spirals once upon a time. By virtue of various processes, the rich gas content
responsible for the spiral patterns was stripped out and started fading. today,
these galaxies resemble what we call s0 galaxies.</p>

<h2>Spectroscopic Study</h2>

<p>Photometric studies i.e. studies done using images are limited in the amount of
information they can give us. A spectrum on the other hand can unravel far many
more details about individual objects. thus the second part of my thesis
focussed on using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) to obtain rich
spectral information about these objects. (a spectrum basically measures
brightness of the object at different wavelengths.)</p>

<p>SALT was a relatively new telescope when i was getting started. so, the precise
methods by which one could process and clean the data were not fully known. A
good part of thesis research was spent in developing complex python codes which
could be used to clean up the data and obtain the final usable spectrum.</p>

<p>Once this was in place, I could use very complex modeling techniques that
basically answer the following question - how much percent of light in this
galaxy is coming from stars of different ages? So, if a galaxy had 95% of its
light coming from very old stars, I'd conclude that most of the galaxy formed a
very long time back. But <em> long time back </em>, the conditions in the
universe were different and so there could only be a limited number of processes
that would have been responsible. Opposite would be true if I found galaxy light to be
dominated by younger stars.</p>

<p>A major conclusion from this work was that while statistically, the special set
of S0 galaxies I worked with were indeed showing certain trends, when inspected
on a case by case basis, each object was unique. Each object has certain
peculiar features and told a story quite different from the other.</p>
