<p> In my position as a Data Scientist, I have largely worked on projects more to do
    with data archiving, visualization, curation and serving. This work does not
    sound glamorous to the modern generation of people who have come to
    associate data science with running <em> cool </em> machine learning
    algorithms to discover secrets hidden within the data. But the need for
    good, high quality and well maintained data with services to access these
    is often brushed under the carpet when talking about data science. Of
    course, that does not mean that predictive analytics isn't important, in my
    opinion. I simply wish to point out that if your data is not in order, there
    is no use of having access to the best visualization and analytics routines!

<h2 id="kso-dda"> The Kodaikanal Digitized Data Archive </h2>

<p> The Kodaikanal Solar observatory is operational since more than a century.
    Dedicated observers have been at work since 1904, imaging the sun using
    photographic plates. Given that the sun exhibits periodical changes such as
    sun spots over periods spanning decades, such a data set becomes immensely
    important. To make the data amenable to the sophisticated analysis
    computerized routines available, they must be present in digitized form.
    The folks at Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA, which now operates the
    Kodaikanal Observatory), have carried out an immense undertaking, lasting
    several years, to digitize these data. </p>

<p> As a part of my project, we decided to build an archive for them. We used
    modern web frameworks to design a data archive which would make data access
    easier for the scientific community. Novel features we included in this site
    include the following: </p>

<ul>
    <li> An interactive histogram based visualization, coded using D3.js which
        allows users to get a feel for the distribution of the data spanning
        100+ years. </li>
    <li>
        A time uniformity visualization which informs the user about the
        sampling uniformity along time, for a given search data set. This helps
        the user make informed decisions about whether the data is amenable for
        the nature of analysis intended. </li>

    <li>
        A Virtual Solar Observatory compatible SOAP service layer. This will
        enable generic data scraping tools capable of speaking the VSO SOAP
        specification, to stumble across Kodaikanal digitized data. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="biological"> Data Archiving Solutions for Biological Data </h2>

<p> I am also working with colleages from Regional Centre of Biotechnology, at
    Faridabad to design data storage and dissemination solutions for large data
    sets gathered using complex instruments such as the new X-Ray Diffraction
    facility at the European Sycnhrotron Research Facility. Generally,
    biological data have been produced in personal labs and thus the need for a
    centralized archive with appropriate search and download services has been
    scarce. However, the situation in Astronomy has been the opposite.
    Astronomers often have had to work in far-off locations in facilities hard
    to construct using a single lab's resources. </p>

<p> The idea of this ongoing work is to adopt battle tested techniques from
    Astronomy and apply them to help organize biological data better. </b>


<h2 id="czti-dms"> The CZTI Data Management System </h2>

<p> The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Image (CZTI) is one of five payloads onboard the
    Astrosat satellite, the first ever space telescope launched by India. The
    Payload Operations Center for this instrument is situated ... well, right
    next to where I sit! So, in collaboration with them, we decided to do some
    complex database management system development. Features include: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Detailed track of every single processing pipeline parameter including
        the SVN checkout version. </li>
    <li> A modern web based GUI for searching observations based on a number of
        input parameters. </li>
    <li> Search results include options such as previewing history of the
        processing, information about multiple versions of data products etc.
    </li>
</ul>

<p> In an ideally planned project, such a system would allow storage of detailed
    metadata, sufficient to construct any version of the data product. Thus, as
    new versions get created, one may dispose of these products knowing that
    should the need arise, the metadata can be used to reconstruct the product
    on demand. </p>

<h2 id="crts-web-app"> The CRTS Image Archive </h2>

<p> The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey is a collection of three telescopes
    which have operated over a period spanning more than a decade. The
    telescopes visit specific areas of the sky at defined intervals of time and
    take images. These images are then processed to derive photometric
    measurements. IUCAA is a host to the image archive. Some features of this
    image archive include: </p>

<ul>
    <li> A script that cuts-out the large field images into small images with
        more convenient footprint and manageable size. </li>

    <li> A MySQL database with 8 billion records, which utilize the Hierarchical
        Triangular Mesh (HTM) to enable speedy searches based on the 2-d
        position on the celestial sphere. </li>

    <li> A Virtual Observatory (Simple Image Access Protocol) compliant web
        service that allows all VO compatible tools to access these images.
    </li>
</ul>

        accessed here. </a> </p>
